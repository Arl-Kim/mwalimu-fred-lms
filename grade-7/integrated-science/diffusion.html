    <h5>Diffusion</h5>
    <h6>An Experiment to Demonstrate Diffusion in Liquids</h6>
    <h6>Requirements</h6>
    <ul>
        <li>Beaker</li>
        <li>Water</li>
        <li>Dye or Ink</li>
        <li>A Dropper</li>
        <li>Writing Materials</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h6>Procedure</h6>
    <ul>
        <li>Pour some water in a beaker.</li>
        <li>Put a drop of ink or dye in the water</li>
        <li>What observations do you make after a few minutes? </li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h6>Observation, Explanation and Conclusion</h6>
    <ul>
        <li>After a few minutes, the ink or dye spread throughout the water in the beaker. </li>
        <li>The ink or dye spread from the region where it was highly concentrated to region in water to where it was in low concentration. </li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <em><strong>Diffusion</strong> is defined as <strong id=tolight>the movement of molecules from a region of high concentration to a region of low concentration.</strong></em>

    <h6>An Experiment to Demonstrate Diffusion in Gasses</h6>
    <h6>Requirements</h6>
    <ul>
        <li>A bottle of perfume of scented flowers</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h6>Procedure</h6>
    <ul>
        <li>Place the scented flower in a corner of the classroom.</li>
        <li>Remove the stopper of the perfume, hold it a few centimeters away from your friendâ€™s nose.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h6>Observation, Explanation and Conclusion</h6>
    <ul>
        <li>After a few seconds, you and your classmates will be able to smell the scent of the flower or perfume.
            This is due to diffusion. The scent of the flower and perfume molecules diffuse the air to their nose. </li>
        <li>Molecules in the scent of flower or perfume moved from the region of high concentration and spread evenly towards the region of 
            low concentration. </li>
        <li>Diffusion in gasses also makes it possible for us to smell things, for example, flowers, food being cooked and also foul smells.</li>
    </ul>
