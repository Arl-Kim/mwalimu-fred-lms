    <h5>Multiplying Simple Fractions</h5>
    <p><strong id="togreen">Step 1</strong> – Multiply the numerators</p>
    <p><strong id="togreen">Step 2</strong> – Multiply the denominators</p>
    <p><strong id="togreen">Step 3</strong> – Reduce the answer to lowest terms by dividing by common divisors</p>
    <br>
    <h6>Example</h6>
    <p>¹/₇ × ⁴/₁₂ = ⁴/₁₂ which reduces to ²/₂₁</p>
    <br>
    <h5>Multiplying Mixed Numbers</h5>
    <p><strong id="togreen">Step 1</strong> – Convert the mixed numbers to improper fractions first</p>
    <p><strong id="togreen">Step 2</strong> – Multiply the numerators</p>
    <p><strong id="togreen">Step 3</strong> – Multiply the denominators</p>
    <p><strong id="togreen">Step 4</strong> – Reduce the answer to lowest terms</p>
    <br>
    <h6>Example</h6>
    <p>2¹/₃ × 1¹/₂ = ⁷/₃ × ³/₂ = ²¹/₆ which then reduces to 3¹/₂</p>

    <p><strong id="togreen">Note:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>When opposing numerators and denominators are divisible by a common number, you may reduce the numerator and denominator before multiplying.</li>
        <li>In the above example, after converting the mixed numbers to improper fractions, you will see that the 3 in the numerator and the opposing 3 in the denominator could have been reduced by dividing both numbers by 3, resulting in the following reduced fraction: ⁷/₃ × ³/₂ = ⁷/₂</li>
    </ul>

    <h5>Dividing Simple Fractions</h5>
    <p><strong id="togreen">Step 1</strong> – Change division sign to multiplication</p>
    <p><strong id="togreen">Step 2</strong> – Change the fraction following the multiplication sign to its reciprocal (rotate the fraction around so the old denominator is the new numerator and the old numerator is the new denominator)</p>
    <p><strong id="togreen">Step 3</strong> – Multiply the numerators</p>
    <p><strong id="togreen">Step 4</strong> – Multiply the denominators</p>
    <p><strong id="togreen">Step 5</strong> – Simplify the answer to lowest terms</p>
    <br>
    <h6>Example</h6>
    <p>¹/₈ ÷ ²/₃ becomes ¹/₈ × ³/₂ which when solved is ³/₁₆</p>
    <br>
    <h5>Dividing Mixed Numbers</h5>
    <p><strong id="togreen">Step 1</strong> – Convert the mixed number or numbers to improper fractions</p>
    <p><strong id="togreen">Step 2</strong> – Change the division sign to multiplication</p>
    <p><strong id="togreen">Step 3</strong> – Change the fraction following the multiplication sign to its reciprocal (flip the fraction around so the old denominator is the new numerator and the old numerator is the new denominator)</p>
    <p><strong id="togreen">Step 4</strong> – Multiply the numerators</p>
    <p><strong id="togreen">Step 5</strong> – Multiply the denominators</p>
    <p><strong id="togreen">Step 6</strong> – Simplify the answer to lowest form</p>
    <br>
    <h6>Example</h6>
    <p>3³/₄ ÷ 2⁵/₆ becomes ¹⁵/₄ ÷ ¹⁷/₆ becomes ¹⁵/₄ × ⁶/₁₇ which when solved is:</p>
    <p>¹⁵/₄ × ⁶/₁₇ = ⁴⁵/₃₄ which simplifies to 1¹¹/₃₄</p>
