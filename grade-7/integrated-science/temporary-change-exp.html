    <h5>Temporary and Permanent Changes in Substances</h5>

    <h6>Temporary Physical Changes</h6>

    <h6>Experiment to Demonstrate Physical Change</h6>

    <h6>Requirements:</h6>
    <ul>
        <li>A pair of tongs</li>
        <li>An iron pin</li>
        <li>A source of heat such as a burning candle or Bunsen burner</li>
        <li>Writing materials</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h6>Procedure:</h6>
    <ul>
        <li>Hold the iron pin using a pair of tongs over a burning flame from either a candle or Bunsen burner for some time.</li>
        <li>Remove the pin from the flame after noticing any changes you can observe.</li>
    </ul>

    <h6>Observations, Explanation & Conclusion:</h6>
    <ul>
        <li>The iron pin becomes red-hot when heated.</li>
        <li>After some time, the iron pin regains its original color on cooling.</li>
        <li>This indicates that the iron pin went through a temporary change on heating.</li>
        <li>Any change in properties such as shape, size, color, and state of a substance is called a <strong id="tolight">physical change</strong>.</li>
        <li>Physical changes are reversible.</li>
        <li>When a change is reversible, it is said to be temporary. This is demonstrated when the heated red-hot iron pin regains its original color after cooling.</li>
    </ul>
