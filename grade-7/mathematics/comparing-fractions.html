    <h5>Comparing Fractions</h5>
    <p>When comparing fractions, they are first converted into their equivalent forms using the same denominator.</p>
    <h6>Equivalent Fractions</h6>
    <p>To get the equivalent fractions, we multiply or divide the numerator and denominator of a given fraction by the same number. When the fraction has no factor in common other than 1, the fraction is said to be in its <strong id="tolight">simplest form</strong>.</p>
    <br>
    <h6>Example</h6>
    <p>Arrange the following fractions in ascending order (from the smallest to the biggest):<br><strong id="tolight">½, ¼, ⁵/₆, ⅔</strong></p>
    <p><strong id="togreen">Step 1:</strong> Change all the fractions to the same denominator.</p>
    <p>
        <strong id="togreen">Step 2:</strong> In this case we will use 12 because 2, 4, 6, and3 all go into i.e. We get 12 by finding the L.C.M of the denominators.<br>To get the equivalent fractions divide the denominator by the L.C.M and then multiply both the numerator and denominator by the answer,<br>For ½ we divide 12 ÷ 2 = 6, then multiply both the numerator and denominator by 6 as shown below.<br>1<sup>x6</sup>/2<sup>x4</sup>, 1<sup>x3</sup>/4<sup>x3</sup>, 5<sup>x2</sup>/6<sup>x2</sup>, 2<sup>x4</sup>/3<sup>x4</sup>
    </p>

    <p><strong id="togreen">Step 3:</strong> The fractions will now be:<br>⁶/₁₂, ³/₁₂, ¹⁰/₁₂, ⁸/₁₂</p>
    <p><strong id="togreen">Step 4:</strong> Now put your fractions in order (smallest to biggest).
    <br>³/₁₂, ⁶/₁₂, ⁸/₁₂, ¹⁰/₁₂</p>
    <p><strong id="togreen">Step 5:</strong> Change back, keeping them in order.<br>¼, ½, ⅔, ⁵/₆</p>
    <br>
    <p>You can also use percentages to compare fractions as shown below.</p>
    <h6>Example</h6>
    <p>
        Arrange the following in descending order (from the biggest):<br><strong id="tolight">⁵/₁₂, ⁷/₃, ¹¹/₅, ⁹/₄</strong>
    </p>
    <h6>Solution</h6>
    <p>⁵/₁₂ × 100 = 41.67%</p>
    <p>⁷/₃ × 100 = 233.3%</p>
    <p>¹¹/₅ × 100 = 220%</p>
    <p>⁹/₄ × 100 = 225%</p>
    <p> ⁷/₃, ⁹/₄, ¹¹/₅, ⁵/₁₂</p>
