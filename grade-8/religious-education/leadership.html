    <h6>Reasons for Kingship in Israel</h6>
    <p><strong id="tolight">Kingship</strong> refers to rule by a king. The Israelites demanded for a king because:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Samuel's sons Joel and Abijah were corrupt and they took bribes.</li>
        <li>The Israelites wanted a warrior king to lead them in wars and battles and bring victory to Israel.</li>
        <li>They wanted a king so as to be like other nations around them who were led by kings.</li>
        <li>The Israelites wanted a human king whom they could see and approach.</li>
        <li>They wanted a stable political government ruled by laws and orders.</li>
    </ul><br>
    <h6>Reasons Against Kingship According to Prophet Samuel</h6>
    <p>There were a number of reasons why it was wrong to establish a kingship system in Israel. Some of the reasons according to Samuel were:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>By demanding a king, the Israelites were rejecting Yahweh as their unseen ruler.</li>
        <li>Kingship system in Israel threatened to destroy their true identity as the people of God.</li>
        <li>Israelites were forgetting that they were a unique nation and so they could not be like other nations.</li>
        <li>Yahweh would reject them when they cried to Him.</li>
        <li>The king would not treat the Israelites well.</li>
    </ul><br>
    <h6>God Told Samuel to Warn the Israelites and Explain to Them that the King Would:</h6>
    <ul>
        <li>Force them to serve in the army.</li>
        <li>Introduce forced labor.</li>
        <li>Grab their land or vineyards for government use.</li>
        <li>Force them to pay high taxes to the government.</li>
        <li>Turn them into slaves.</li>
        <li>Force their daughters to work for his wives and for the royal house.</li>
