    <h5>Magnification of Cells</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>Magnification of a specimen is the measure of how much bigger a specimen is when it is viewed through a hand lens or
            microscope compared to its original size. </li>
        <li>Magnification is usually expressed using “X” before the digits, for example, X2, X10 and X20. The X stands for ‘times.’</li>
        <li>It is a measure of how much bigger an object appears when viewed through a hand lens or microscope,
            for example X2 means the object has been magnified or enlarged two times or the image is twice bigger than the actual object.</li>
        <li>For a light microscope, the final magnified image of an object as seen by the observer is the product of the magnifying power of the lenses that are used.
            These lenses include eyepiece lens and the objective lens.</li>
        <li>The magnifying power of each of these lenses is marked on the sides of the objective and eyepiece lens holder.</li>
        <li>In a light microscope, the revolving nose-piece holds three different objective lenses, each with a specific magnifying power of X4, X10 and X40.
            The eyepiece lens further magnifies the image formed by the objective lens.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h6>Calculating the Total Magnification</h6>
    <ul>
        <li>Finding total magnification of an image you are viewing in a light microscope is done by:
            Take the power of the objective lens you are using
            e.g., X4, or X10 or X40 and multiply it by the power of the eyepiece lens, which is usually X10.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <p><strong>Total magnification = magnification of eyepiece lens x magnification of objective lens</strong></p>
