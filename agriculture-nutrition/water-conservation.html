    <h5>Water Conservation Methods in Farming</h5>
    <ul>
        <li><strong id="togreen">Mulch</strong> - We cannot overemphasize the importance of mulching. Mulch is something <strong id="tolight">laid on the surface of the soil </strong>to protect the soil from the air, water and the sun.
            To mulch, first <strong id="tolight">weed the soil</strong> then spread a <strong id="tolight">thick layer of organic mulch </strong>on the soil. Examples of organic mulches are:
            <ul>
                <li> Chopped leaves</li>
                <li>Straw</li>
                <li>Grass clippings</li>
                <li>Wood chips</li>
                <li>Shredded bark</li>
                <li>Pine needles</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li> Mulching helps save time and labour as it discourages weeds and pests and conserve water through reduced evaporation.</li>

        <li><strong id="togreen">Irrigate early morning or dusk</strong> - At the hottest and driest time of the year it is most efficient to water your crops in the morning or in the evening. This avoids water <strong id="tolight">loss from evapotranspiration</strong> (water evaporating from the land and leaves of plants). Evaporation happens most in the <strong id="tolight">midday sun.</strong></li>

        <li><strong id="togreen">Don't over-water</strong> - It's a common misconception that plants would be happy with lots of water all of the time. But often farmers are over-watering crops unnecessarily. <strong id="tolight">Save water!</strong> Plants will only take what they need and then all that extra water goes to waste through<strong id="tolight"> evaporation, run-off or infiltration</strong></li>.

        <li><strong id="togreen">Check for leaks and damage</strong> - If you've already invested in an irrigation system, make sure you're not losing any water before it reaches the crops. Irrigation pipes and equipment can become <strong id="tolight">damaged or blocked</strong> which causes leaks. <strong id="tolight">Thoroughly check your equipment for leaks </strong>and repair them so that all the water you have gets to the crops.</li>

        <li><strong id="togreen">Drip Irrigation </strong>- Drip irrigation systems deliver water directly to a plant's roots, <strong id="tolight">reducing the evaporation </strong>that happens with spray watering systems. Timers can be used to schedule watering for the cooler parts of the day, further<strong id="tolight">reducing water loss</strong></li>
    </ul> .
