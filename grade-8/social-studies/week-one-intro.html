    <h5>Introduction</h5>
    <p>In Grade 7, we learnt that the main goal of teaching Social Studies is to teach students to become good citizens. We live in a diverse societyâ€”one that requires knowledge of Social Studies to succeed. With a Social Studies background, children become adults who can participate civilly in our democratic society. Social Studies connect students with the real world. Social Studies help us to understand the world, its history, cultures, and societies. It covers topics such as history, geography, civics, economics, and culture. We learn about different civilizations, events, governments, and critical thinking skills.</p>
    <p>In this week, we will learn about <strong id="togreen">Personal Goal Setting</strong>, <strong id="togreen">Building Self-Esteem</strong>, and <strong id="togreen">Emotional Care</strong>.</p>
