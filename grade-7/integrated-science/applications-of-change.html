    <h6>Applications of Changes of State of Matter in Day-to-Day Life</h6>
    <p>Change of state of matter has many applications in day-to-day life. Some of these changes are: </p>
    <h6>Refrigerators.</h6>
    <ul>
        <li>Liquids evaporate and absorbs heat in the process. 
            A refrigerator works by using a liquid to remove heat from the food items inside and transfer it to the surrounding. 
            The liquid is first heated and then cooled at the back of the fridge where the heat is removed. 
            The process of changing liquid to gas cools the food.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h6>Ice Cream Vendor.</h6>
    <ul>
        <li>Ice cream vendors place ice inside their ice cream carts. 
            The ice absorbs heat from the container surrounds and change to a gas. 
            This leaves the inside of the ice cream cart cold, thus maintaining the ice cream in frozen state.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h6>Melting Metals.</h6>
    <ul>
        <li>Metals are heated to a molten state making it possible to shape and form them into desired objects or structures.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h6>Generating Electricity</h6>
    <ul>
        <li>Water can be converted to steam, which can in turn be used to drive turbines to generate electricity.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h6>Fog Formation</h6>
    <ul>
        <li>Fog forms when water vapour (gaseous state) condenses. 
            During condensation, molecule of water of water vapour combine to make tiny liquid water droplets that are suspended in the air. 
            Fog reduces visibility. Some animals such as insects, depend on fog as a source of water, especially in desert climate. </li>
    </ul>
