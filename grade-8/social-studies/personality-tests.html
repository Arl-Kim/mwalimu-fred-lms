    <h5>TOPIC ONE: PERSONALITY TESTS</h5>
    <p>Personality tests are tools that help you understand your unique traits and characteristics. They ask questions or present scenarios to assess your personality. They provide insights into your strengths, preferences, and how you interact with others. They can be fun and informative, but remember that they are not definitive or absolute. They are just one way to learn more about yourself and should be used as a tool for self-discovery and personal growth.</p>

    <h6>Various Tools Used to Carry Out Personality Tests</h6>
