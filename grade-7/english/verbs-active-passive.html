    <div class="active-voice">
        <h6>Active Voice</h6>
        <p>A verb is in <strong id="tolight">active voice</strong> when the subject of the sentence <strong id="tolight">performs</strong> the action.</p>
        <p><strong id="togreen">Examples:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong id="tolight">Our teacher punished</strong> us for making noise in class.<br>
                <span class="example-detail">Subject: Our teacher - Action: punished</span>
            </li>
            <br>
            <li><strong id="tolight">Players arrived</strong> for their first match early in the morning.<br>
                <span class="example-detail">Subject: Players - Action: arrived</span>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <br>

    <br>
    <div class="passive-voice">
        <h6>Passive Voice</h6>
        <p>The word <strong id="tolight">passive</strong> means "acted upon". When the subject of the sentence <strong id="tolight">receives</strong> the action or <strong id="tolight">expresses</strong> the result of the action, the verb is in <strong id="toblue">passive voice</strong>.</p>
        <p><strong id="togreen">Examples:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong id="tolight">We were punished</strong> by the teacher for making noise.<br>
                <span class="example-detail">Subject: We - Action: were punished</span>
            </li>
            <br>
            <li><strong id="tolight">He was helped</strong> by a passer-by.<br>
                <span class="example-detail">Subject: He - Action: was helped</span>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <p>In the above sentences, the subjects <strong id="tolight">we</strong> and <strong id="tolight">he</strong> receive the action.</p>
        <p>When we do not know who or what did the action, or when we do not want to say who or what did it, we use the <strong id="toblue">passive voice</strong>.</p>
        <p>The passive form of a verb consists of some form of <strong id="tolight">be</strong> plus the <strong id="toblue">past participle</strong>.</p>
