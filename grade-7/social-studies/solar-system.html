    <h5>The origin of the solar system</h5>
        <h6>The passing star theory</h6>
            <ul>
                <li>A star with a greater gravitational pull passed near the sun</li>
                <li>It attracted large quantities of gaseous materials from the sun</li>
                <li>The materials split, cooled and condensed to form planets</li>
                <li>The planets were set in orbit by the passing star</li>
            </ul>
        <h6>The nebula cloud theory</h6>
            <ul>
                <li>There was a slowly rotating cloud of dust and gas called Nebula</li>
                <li>It cooled and began to contact</li>
                <li>Rotation speed increased and successive rings of gaseous materials were formed.</li>
                <li>The rings condensed to form planets</li>
                <li>The central gaseous material remained as the sun</li>
            </ul>
                <h5>Size of the earth</h5>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Equatorial diameter-12756km</li>
                        <li>Equatorial circumference-40085km</li>
                        <li>Polar diameter-39995km</li>
                        <li>Surface area of the earth-510×106 km2</li>
                        <li>Water surface - 73%.</li>
                    </ul>
                        <h5>Mercury</h5>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Nearest from the sun</li>
                                <li>Its 58m km from the sun</li>
                                <li>Has no satellites</li>
                                <li>Takes approximately 88 earth days to revolve around the sun</li>
                            </ul>
                                <h5>Venus</h5>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>2nd planet from the sun</li>
                                        <li>It’s 108m km from the sun</li>
                                        <li>One of the brightest planets</li>
                                        <li>Can be seen clearly with naked eyes</li>
                                        <li>Takes approximately 225 earth days to revolve around the sun</li>
                                        <li>Slightly smaller than the earth</li>
                                        <li>Has no satellites</li>
                                        <li>Together with the earth they are called twin planets due to having many similarities</li>
                                    </ul>
