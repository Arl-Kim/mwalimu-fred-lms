    <h5>Operations On Integers</h5>
    <h6>Addition Of Integers</h6>
    <ul>
        <li>Addition of integers can be represented on a number line.</li>
        <li>For example, to add +3 to 0 , we begin at 0 and move 3 units to the right as shown below in red to get +3.</li>
        <li>Also to add + 4 to +3 we move 4 units to the right as shown below in blue to get +7.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>To add -3 to zero we move 3 units to the left as shown in red below to get -3 while to add -2 to -3 we move 2 steps to the left as shown in blue to get -5.</p>

    <p><strong id="togreen">Note:</strong><br>- When adding positive numbers we move to the right.<br>- When dealing with negative we move to the left.</p>
    <br>
    <h6>Subtraction Of Integers</h6>

    <p>
        <strong id="togreen">Example:</strong><br>(+7) – (0) = (+7)<br>To subtract +7 from 0 ,we find a number n which when added to get 0 we get +7 and in this case n = +7 as shown above in red.<br>
        <strong id="togreen">Example:</strong><br>(+2) – (+7) = (-5)<br>Start at +7 and move to +2. 5 steps will be made towards the left. The answer is therefore -5.<br>
        <strong id="togreen">Example:</strong><br>
        -3 – (+6) = -9 <br>
|   |_←|	|	|	|	|	| |←| | | | | | <br>
-4 -3 -2   -1  0   1   2  3	4  5  6   7   8   9   10
        <br><br>We start at +6 and moves to -3. 9 steps to the left, the answer is -9.<br><br>
        <strong id="togreen">Note:</strong><br>In general positives signs can be ignored when writing positive numbers i.e. +2 can be written as 2 but negative signs cannot be ignored when writing negative numbers -4 can only be written as -4.<br>4 – (+3) = 4 -3 = 1 <br>-3- (+6) =3 – 6 = -3 <br><br>Positive integers are also referred to as natural numbers. The result of subtracting the negative of a number is the same as adding that number. <br> 2 – (- 4) = 2 + 4 = 6 <br> (-5) – (- 1) = -5 + 2 = -3 <br><br>In mathematics it is assumed that that the number with no sign before it has a positive sign.         
    </p>

    <h6>Multiplication Of Integers</h6>
    <p>In General:</p>
    <ul>
        <li id="tolight">(a negative number) x (appositive number ) = (a negative number)</li>
        <li id="tolight">(a positive number) x (a negative number ) = (a negative number)</li>
        <li id="tolight">(a negative number) x (a negative number ) = (a positive number)</li>
    </ul><br>
    <p>
        <strong id="togreen">Examples:</strong><br>-6 x 5 = -30<br>7 x -4 = - 28<br>-3 x -3 = 9<br>-2 x -9 = 18
    </p>
    <br>
    <h6>Division Of Integers</h6>
    <p>Division is the inverse of multiplication. In general:</p>
    <ul>
        <li id="tolight">(a positive number ) ÷ (a positive number ) = (a positive number)</li>
        <li id="tolight">(a positive number ) ÷ (a negative number ) = (a negative number)</li>
        <li id="tolight">(a negative number ) ÷ (a negative number ) = (a positive number)</li>
        <li id="tolight">(a negative number ) ÷ (a positive number ) = (a negative number)</li>
    </ul><br>
    <p>
        For multiplication and division of integer:<br>
        - Two like signs gives positive sign. Two unlike signs gives negative sign<br>
        - Multiplication by zero is always zero and division by zero is always zero.
