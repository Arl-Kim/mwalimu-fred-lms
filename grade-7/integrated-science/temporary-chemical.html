    <h6>Experiment to Demonstrate Temporary Chemical Changes</h6>
    <h6 id="toblue">Requirements:</h6>
    <ul>
        <li>Safety googles</li>
        <li>Two test tubes</li>
        <li>Deliver tube right angled</li>
        <li>Beaker 250ml</li>
        <li>Bunsen burner</li>
        <li>Clamp</li>
        <li>Stand</li>
        <li>5g of hydrated copper (II) sulphate</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h6 id="toblue">Procedure</h6>
    <p>Put 5g of powdered blue hydrated copper (II) sulphate in the test tube. - Set up the experiment as shown below.</p>

    <br>
    <h6>Observation, Explanation and Conclusion</h6>
    <ul>
        <li>✓ When <strong id="tolight">blue hydrated copper (II) sulphate</strong> is heated in the test tube as shown above, it turns colour from blue to white. This is because it loses water which was making it hydrated.</li>
        <li>✓ After losing water, it becomes <strong id="tolight">white anhydrous copper (II) sulphate</strong>.</li>
        <li>✓ When water is added to the <strong id="tolight">white anhydrous copper (II) sulphate</strong>, it turns back to its original blue colour.</li>
        <li>✓ The chemical change that had occurred is reversed. Some chemical changes are therefore temporary and can be reversed easily. These changes are referred to as <strong id="toblue">temporary chemical changes</strong> or <strong id="toblue">reversible chemical changes</strong>.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h6>Other examples of temporary chemical changes include the following:</h6>
    <ul>
        <li>On mixing baking soda and vinegar, a chemical reaction produces <strong id="tolight">carbon (IV) oxide</strong> gas. This gas causes the mixture to bubble. Once the gas escapes into the air, the reaction stops, and the mixture returns to its original state.</li>
        <li>Freezing, melting, and vaporization of water.</li>
    </ul>
