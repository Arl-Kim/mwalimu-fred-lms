    <h5>Reflexive and Intensive Pronouns</h5>
    <p><strong id="toblue">Reflexive</strong> and <strong id="toblue">intensive</strong> pronouns end in <strong id="tolight">-self</strong> or <strong id="tolight">-selves</strong>. These are <strong id="tolight">myself</strong>, <strong id="tolight">yourself</strong>, <strong id="tolight">herself</strong>, <strong id="tolight">himself</strong>, <strong id="tolight">itself</strong>, <strong id="tolight">ourselves</strong>, and <strong id="tolight">themselves</strong>. There is, however, one difference between <strong id="toblue">reflexive</strong> and <strong id="toblue">intensive</strong> pronouns.</p>
    <h6>Reflexive Pronouns</h6>
    <p>A <strong id="toblue">reflexive pronoun</strong> refers to an action performed by the subject of the sentence. The meaning of the sentence is incomplete without the reflexive pronoun.</p>
    <h6>Examples:</h6>
    <p>Monicah bought herself a new dress. (The meaning of the sentence is incomplete without the reflexive pronoun because we do not know for whom Monicah bought the dress.)</p>
    <h6>Intensive Pronouns</h6>
    <p>An <strong id="toblue">intensive pronoun</strong> is used to emphasize a noun or a pronoun. It does not add information to a sentence, and it can be removed without changing the meaning of the sentence.</p>
    <p>I <strong id="tolight">myself</strong> pulled the boy out of the river. (If you remove <strong id="tolight">myself</strong>, the meaning of the sentence does not change.)</p>
