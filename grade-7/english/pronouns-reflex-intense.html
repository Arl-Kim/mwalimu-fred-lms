    <h5>Reflexive and Intensive Pronouns</h5>
    <div><br></div>
    <p>Reflexive and intensive pronouns end in <strong>-self</strong> or <strong>-selves</strong>. These are <strong>myself</strong>, <strong>yourself</strong>, <strong>herself</strong>, <strong>himself</strong>, <strong>itself</strong>, <strong>ourselves</strong>, and <strong>themselves</strong>. There is, however, one difference between reflexive and intensive pronouns.</p>
    <p><br></p>

    <h5>Reflexive Pronouns</h5>
    <div><br></div>
    <p>A <strong id="tolight">reflexive pronoun</strong> refers to an action performed by the subject of the sentence. The meaning of the sentence is incomplete without the reflexive pronoun.</p>
    <div class="examples">
        <p>Monicah bought herself a new dress. (The meaning of the sentence is incomplete without the reflexive pronoun because we do not know for whom Monicah bought the dress.)</p>
        <p><br></p>
    </div>

    <h5>Intensive Pronouns</h5>
    <div><br></div>
    <p>An <strong id="tolight">intensive pronoun</strong> is used to emphasize a noun or a pronoun. It does not add information to a sentence, and it can be removed without changing the meaning of the sentence.</p>
    <div class="examples">
        <p>I myself pulled the boy out of the river. (If you remove myself, the meaning of the sentence does not change.)</p>
