    <h5>CREATION</h5>
    <h5>1.1 - Origin and Consequences of Sin</h5>
    <h6>Origin of sin from the creation accounts</h6>
    <ul>
        <li><strong id="tolight">Sin</strong> is rebellion against the law of God.</li>
        <li>It is disobedience to God.</li>
        <li>It is also a deliberate and purposeful violation of the will of God.</li>
        <li><strong id="tolight">Origin</strong> means source.</li>
        <li>God placed Adam and Eve in the garden of Eden to cultivate and guard it.</li>
        <li>He gave them the freedom to eat the fruit of every tree in the garden except the tree that gives knowledge of what is good or bad.</li>
        <li>God warned them that if they ate the forbidden fruit, they would die the same day.</li>
        <li>The snake, being a cunning animal, cheated Eve that if she ate the fruit, she would not die, but be like God.</li>
        <li>Eve was convinced by the snake. She ate the fruit and gave some to Adam, who also ate.</li>
        <li>After eating the fruit, Adam and Eve were given understanding. They realized they were naked.</li>
        <li>Sin originated from the disobedience of Adam and Eve. They disobeyed God by eating the forbidden fruit, thus, rebellion against Him.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h6>Adam and Eve fell into sin because of the following reasons:</h6>
    <ul>
        <li>They fell into the temptation of Satan, who appeared to Eve in the form of a snake.</li>
        <li>They desired to be like God.</li>
        <li>They disobeyed Godâ€™s instructions and rebelled against Him.</li>
        <li>They were greedy and selfish.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h6>Consequences of sin after the fall of man:</h6>
    <p>Consequence refers to the results or effects of an action or a situation. The following are the consequences of sin from the Bible:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The snake was cursed and given a punishment to crawl on its belly and eat dust.</li>
        <li>Enmity developed between the snake and the woman and their offspring.</li>
        <li>Woman would experience trouble in pregnancy and increased pain while giving birth, and she would also be subject to her husband.</li>
        <li>The ground was cursed, and it started producing weeds and thorns.</li>
        <li>Man had to toil in order to produce enough food from the ground.</li>
        <li>Adam and Eve were sent out of the garden of Eden.</li>
        <li>Human beings would become more prone to sin.</li>
        <li>Human beings started killing one another.</li>
