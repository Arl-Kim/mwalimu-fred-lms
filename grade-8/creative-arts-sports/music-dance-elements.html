    <h5>Elements of Dance in Creative Arts</h5>
    <ol type="a">
        <li><strong id="tolight">Body</strong> - In dance, the body is the mobile figure or shape, felt by the dancer, seen by others. The body is sometimes relatively still and sometimes changing as the dancer moves in place or travels through the dance area. The body is the mobile instrument of the dancer and helps inform us of what is moving.</li>
        <li><strong id="tolight">Action</strong> – This is what a dancer does, for example travelling, turning, elevation, gesture, stillness, use of body parts, floor-work, and the transference of weight.</li>
        <li><strong id="tolight">Space</strong> – Space refers to the area through which the dancer's body moves.</li>
        <li><strong id="tolight">Time</strong> - It is an essential part of choreographing and performing dance. It helps us to stay together when we dance in unison, identify the beat and the rhythm of how we move, and provide stimulus for choreography.</li>
