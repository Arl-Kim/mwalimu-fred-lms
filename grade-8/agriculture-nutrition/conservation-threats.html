    <h5>Threats To Soil Conservation</h5>
    <p>The primary threats to soil conservation are:</p>
    <h6>Chemical Contamination</h6>

    <br>
    <p>The use of pesticides can contaminate the soil, as well as nearby vegetation and water sources, with harmful chemicals. In addition to contamination, chemicals used on crops can be toxic to important beneficial insects, such as bees, as well as fish and bird populations. A good example is the growing use of pesticides, herbicides, and toxic fertilizers.</p>
    <h6>Slash and Burn</h6>

    <br>
    <p>Slash-and-burn farming is the practice of burning and clearing forests to make way for farmland. This method kills plant species and displaces wildlife from their natural habitats. Land cleared using slash and burn is only used while it’s productive for farming. Once it loses its fertility, another patch of forest is identified for clearing. This unsustainable process repeats endlessly, preventing soil from recovering sufficiently to support healthy ecosystems.</p>
    <h6>Land Overuse, Overgrazing, etc.</h6>

  	<br>
    <p>Overuse of land can limit soil’s ability to play its part in the global climate cycle. For example, overcutting forests and woodlands for timber and overgrazing pastures can far outpace the natural regrowth of vegetation, subjecting soil to increased exposure to erosion.</p>
