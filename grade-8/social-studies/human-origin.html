    <h5>TOPIC 2: SCIENTIFIC THEORY ABOUT HUMAN ORIGIN</h5>
    <p>The <strong id="tolight">theory of evolution</strong> explains how humans and other living organisms have evolved over time from simpler forms of life. It suggests that we share a common ancestry with other primates and have adapted to different environments through a gradual process. Scientific evidence from fossils, DNA analysis, and comparative anatomy supports this theory.</p>
    <p>Understanding human evolution helps us appreciate our shared origins and the inter-connectedness of all living beings.</p>

    <h6>The Scientific Theory About Human Origin</h6>
    <p>The scientific theory about human origin is called the theory of evolution. It was proposed by a scientist named <strong id="tolight">Charles Darwin</strong> in the 19th century. This theory explains how humans and other living organisms have developed and changed over a very long time.</p>
    <p>According to the theory of evolution, all living things, including humans, share a common ancestor. This means that we have evolved from simpler forms of life over millions of years. It's like a big family tree, where all living organisms are connected in some way.</p>
    <p>The theory of evolution suggests that living things change and adapt to their environment through a process called natural selection. This means that certain traits or characteristics that are helpful for survival and reproduction become more common in a population over time.</p>
    <p>For example, if a certain trait helps an animal find food or avoid predators, individuals with that trait are more likely to survive and pass it on to their offspring.</p>
    <p>Scientists have found a lot of evidence to support the theory of evolution. They study things like <strong id="tolight">fossils</strong> (remains of ancient plants and animals), <strong id="tolight">DNA</strong> (the genetic material that carries information about our traits), and similarities in the body structures of different organisms.</p>

    <h6>The Scientific Theory About Human Origin is Also Called the Evolution Theory</h6>
    <p>It was developed by Charles Darwin.</p>
    <p>The theory argues that all living organisms underwent processes of change over millions of years by evolving from simple forms to complex forms.</p>
    <p>This happened through the processes of:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong id="toblue">Mutation</strong> - Human organisms went through changes in their genes and the behavior of their bodies.</li>
        <li><strong id="toblue">Natural Selection</strong> - After mutation, only the fittest or strongest organisms survived.</li>
        <li><strong id="toblue">Adaptation</strong> - After surviving mutation and natural selection, the organisms adapted to their new environment.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>

    <h6>Stages of Human Evolution</h6>
    <p>The following are stages of human evolution:</p>
