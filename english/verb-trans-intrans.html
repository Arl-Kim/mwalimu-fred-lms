    <div class="transitive-intransitive-verbs">
        <h6>Transitive Verbs</h6>
        <p>Some sentences express a complete thought with only a subject and an action verb.</p>
        <p><strong id="togreen">Example:</strong></p>
        <p>The sun shines.<br>
            <span class="example-detail">Subject: The sun - Action verb: shines</span>
        </p>
        <p>In other sentences, a direct object must follow the action verb for the sentence to be complete. A direct object is a noun or a pronoun that receives the action of the verb.</p>
        <p><strong id="togreen">Example:</strong></p>
        <p>The goalkeeper caught the ball.<br>
            <span class="example-detail">Subject: The goalkeeper - Action verb: caught - Direct object: the ball</span>
        </p>
        <p>A <strong id="tolight">transitive verb</strong> is an action verb that must take a direct object for the sentence to express a complete thought. A direct object answers the question what? or whom?</p>
        <p><strong id="togreen">Examples:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>The captain steered the ship. (Steered what? The ship)</li>
            <li>The teacher praised the students. (Praised whom? The students)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Transitive verbs cannot be used alone without direct objects in sentences; they would not have complete meanings.</p>
        <p><br></p>

    <div class="transitive-intransitive-verbs">
        <h6>Intransitive Verbs</h6>
        <p>An <strong id="tolight">intransitive verb</strong> is an action verb that does not require a direct object for the sentence to have complete meaning.</p>
        <p><strong id="togreen">Examples:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>The ship sailed.<br>
                <span class="example-detail">Subject: The ship - Action verb: sailed</span>
            </li>
            <li>The child smiled.<br>
                <span class="example-detail">Subject: The child - Action verb: smiled</span>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Intransitive verbs do not answer the questions what? or whom? Sometimes they answer the questions how? or how often?</p>
        <p><strong id="togreen">Examples:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>The ship sailed smoothly. (How did it sail? Smoothly)</li>
            <li>The child smiled repeatedly. (How often did the child smile? Repeatedly)</li>
        </ul>

    <div class="both-verbs">
        <h6>Both Transitive and Intransitive Verbs</h6>
        <p>Some verbs can be used both transitively and intransitively.</p>

            </li>
            <li>We cheered noisily. (Intransitive)<br>
                <span class="example-detail">Subject: We - Action verb: cheered</span>
            </li>
            <li>He broke the window pane. (Transitive)<br>
