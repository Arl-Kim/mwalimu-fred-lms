    <h5>Types of Fire Injuries and Their First Aid Requirements</h5>
    <p>Different types of fire injuries require different First aid approaches.<br>The first aid for different fire injuries are as follows:</p>
    <h6>Performing First Aid for fire burns.</h6>
    <ul>
        <li>Assess (find out) the situation to ascertain your own safety.</li>
        <li>Immediately get the person away from the heat sources to stop the burning.</li>
        <li>Cool the burn with cool or lukewarm running water for 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove any clothing or jewellery that is near the burnt area of the skin. Do not move anything stuck to the skin.</li>
        <li>Make sure the person keeps warm using a warm cover such as blanket, but take care not to rub it against the burnt area.</li>
        <li>Cover the burn by placing a layer of cling film over it.</li>
        <li>If the injury is on the face, sit up as much as possible, rather than lying down. This helps to reduce swelling.</li>
