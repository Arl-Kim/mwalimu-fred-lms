    <h5>Roles of Diffusion in Living Things</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>Plants absorb mineral salts from soil through diffusion. </li>
        <li>Nutrients such as <strong id="tolight">glucose</strong>and <strong id="tolight">amino acids</strong> move from the small intestines into the bloodstream of animals by diffusion. </li>
        <li>Cells and unicellular organisms such as amoeba get rid of waste substance through diffusion.</li>
        <li>Gaseous exchange is the process through which gases are transferred across cell membrane to either enter or leave the blood. 
            This process is done by diffusion in human beings in the <strong id="tolight">alveoli</strong> in lungs. 
            <strong id="tolight">Oxygen</strong> gas moves from alveoli where is it is highly concentrated to the blood capillaries where it is lowly concentrated. </li>
        <li>On the other hand, <strong id="tolight">carbon (IV) oxide</strong>moves from the capillaries where 
            it is highly concentrated into the alveoli where it is lowly concentrated to be exhaled out.</li>
    </ul>
