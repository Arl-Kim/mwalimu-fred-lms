    <h5>Decimal Places</h5>
    <p>When the process of carrying out division goes over and over again without ending, we may round off the digits to any number of required digits to the right of decimal points, which are called decimal places.</p>
    
    <h6>Example</h6>
    <p>Round <strong id="toblue">2.832</strong> to the nearest hundredth.</p>
    
    <p><strong id="toblue">Solution</strong></p>
    <p><strong id="toblue">Step 1 –</strong> Determine the place to which the number is to be rounded: <strong id="toblue">2.832</strong></p>
    <p><strong id="toblue">Step 2 –</strong> If the digit to the right of the number to be rounded is less than 5, replace it and all the digits to the right of it by zeros. If the digit to the right of the underlined number is 5 or higher, increase the underlined number by 1 and replace all numbers to the right by zeros. If the zeros are decimal digits, you may eliminate them.</p>
    <p><strong id="toblue">2.832 = 2.830 = 2.83</strong></p>
    
    <h6>Example</h6>
    <p>Round <strong id="toblue">43.5648</strong> to the nearest thousandth.</p>
    
    <p><strong id="toblue">Solution</strong></p>
    <p><strong id="toblue">43.5648 = 43.5650 = 43.565</strong></p>
    
    <h6>Example</h6>
    <p>Round <strong id="toblue">5,897,000</strong> to the nearest hundred thousand.</p>
    
    <p><strong id="toblue">Solution</strong></p>
    <p>5,897,000 = 5,900,000</p>
