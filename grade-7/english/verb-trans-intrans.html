<div class="verbs-types">
    <h5>Transitive and Intransitive Verbs</h5>
    <div class="transitive-intransitive-verbs">
        <p>Some sentences express a complete thought with only a subject and an action verb.</p>
        <p><strong id="togreen">Example:</strong></p>
        <p>The sun shines.<br>
            <span class="example-detail">Subject: The sun - Action verb: shines</span>
        </p>
        <p>In other sentences, a <strong id="toblue">direct object</strong> must follow the action verb for the sentence to be complete. A <strong id="toblue">direct object</strong> is a noun or a pronoun that <strong id="toblue">receives</strong> the action of the verb.</p>
        <p><strong id="togreen">Example:</strong></p>
        <p>The goalkeeper caught the ball.<br>
            <span class="example-detail">Subject: The goalkeeper - Action verb: caught - Direct object: the ball</span>
        </p>
        <h6>Transitive Verbs</h6>
        <p>A <strong id="toblue">transitive verb</strong> is an <strong id="toblue">action verb</strong> that must take a <strong id="toblue">direct object</strong> for the sentence to express a complete thought. A direct object answers the question <strong id="toblue">what?</strong> or <strong id="toblue">whom?</strong></p>
        <p><strong id="togreen">Examples:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>The captain steered the ship. (Steered what? <strong id="tolight">the ship</strong>)</li>
            <li>The teacher praised the students. (Praised whom? <strong id="tolight">The students</strong>)</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <p>Transitive verbs cannot be used alone without direct objects in sentences; they would not have complete meanings.</p>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div class="transitive-intransitive-verbs">
        <h6>Intransitive Verbs</h6>
        <p>An <strong id="toblue">intransitive verb</strong> is an action verb that <strong id="toblue">does not require a direct object</strong> for the sentence to have complete meaning.</p>
        <p><strong id="togreen">Examples:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>The ship sailed.<br>
                <span class="example-detail">Subject: The ship - Action verb: sailed</span>
            </li>
            <li>The child smiled.<br>
                <span class="example-detail">Subject: The child - Action verb: smiled</span>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <p>Intransitive verbs do not answer the questions <strong id="toblue">what?</strong> or <strong id="toblue">whom?</strong> Sometimes they answer the questions <strong id="toblue">how?</strong> or <strong id="toblue">how often?</strong></p>
        <p><strong id="togreen">Examples:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>The ship sailed smoothly. (<strong id="tolight">How</strong> did it sail? <strong id="tolight">Smoothly</strong>)</li>
            <li>The child smiled repeatedly. (<strong id="tolight">How often</strong> did the child smile? <strong id="tolight">Repeatedly</strong>)</li>
        </ul>
