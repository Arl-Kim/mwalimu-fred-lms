    <h5>The Promises God Made to Abraham and Their Importance</h5>
    <p>A promise is a pledge or a declaration that something will happen or will be done. When God called Abraham, He made promises to him.</p>

    <h6>Some of the Promises God Made to Abraham Were:</h6>
    <ul>
        <li>God would give him many descendants who would become a great nation.</li>
        <li>He would be blessed and his name made famous.</li>
        <li>God would bless those who bless him and curse those who curse him.</li>
        <li>Through Abraham, all the nations of the earth would be blessed.</li>
        <li>God would shield him from danger and reward him.</li>
        <li>God would give Abraham a son who would inherit his property.</li>
        <li>Abraham and his descendants would be given the land of Canaan to live in.</li>
        <li>His descendants would be enslaved in a foreign land for <strong id="tolight">400 years</strong>. However, God would punish the nation that enslaves them and free his descendants from captivity.</li>
        <li>Some of Abraham’s descendants would be made kings.</li>
        <li>Abraham would live to a ripe old age, die in peace, and be buried.</li>

    <h6>Importance of God’s Promises to Abraham to Christians Today</h6>
    <ol type="i">
        <li>Just like Abraham, Christians today are called from different backgrounds to serve God.</li>
        <li>God’s promise to Abraham that He would be his shield of protection is seen in Christians’ lives. God continues to protect them in many circumstances.</li>
        <li>From God’s dealing with Abraham, Christians learn that God values a personal relationship with human beings.</li>
        <li>As Abraham left his own people, Christians should leave sinful lives and put their trust in God.</li>
        <li>The promise to Abraham of Canaan (the promised land) is to Christians the hope of new land (heaven).</li>
        <li>Abraham is the father of faith to Christians in the same way he is to the Jews. This is because Christians are Abraham’s descendants through faith in Jesus Christ.</li>
    </ol>
