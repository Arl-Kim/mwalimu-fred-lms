    <h5>Verb Tenses</h5>
    <p>The time of an action or the state of being is expressed by different forms of the verb. These forms are called the <strong id="toblue">tenses</strong> of the verb.</p>
    <p>There are three main forms of a verb: <strong id="toblue">the present</strong>, <strong id="toblue">the past</strong>, or <strong id="toblue">the future</strong>.</p>

    <h6>The Present Tense</h6>
    <p>A verb which is in present tense indicates what the subject of the sentence is doing <strong id="toblue">right now</strong>.</p>

    <h6>Example:</h6>
    <p>The teacher <strong id="tolight">sees</strong> the students.</p>
    <p><strong><br></strong></p>
    <p>The verb <strong id="tolight">sees</strong> tells that the teacher is seeing the students now. To show the present tense, an <strong id="tolght">-s</strong> or <strong id="tolight">-es</strong> is added to most verbs if the subject is singular.</p>

    <p>If the subject is plural, or <strong id="tolight">I</strong> or <strong id="tolight">You</strong>, the <strong id="toblue">-s</strong> or <strong id="toblue">-es</strong> is not added.</p>

    </ol>    
    <br>

    <p><strong><br></strong></p>

    <h6>The Future Tense</h6>

    <p>Evans <strong id="tolight">will take</strong> his car to the garage.</p>
    <p>She <strong id="tolight">will</strong> probably <strong id="tolight">come</strong> with us.</p>
    <p>The verbs <strong id="tolight">will take</strong> and <strong id="tolight">will come</strong> tell us what is going to happen. Hence, they are in future tense.</p>
