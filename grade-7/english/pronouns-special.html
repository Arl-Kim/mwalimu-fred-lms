    <h5>Special Pronouns Problems</h5>
    <div><br></div>

    <h6>1. Double Subjects</h6>
    <div><br></div>
    <p>We all know that every sentence must have a subject. Sometimes we incorrectly use a double subject - a noun and a pronoun - to name the same person, place, or thing.</p>
    <div class="examples">
        <p><strong>Incorrect:</strong> Jane she is my cousin.</p>
        <p><strong>Correct:</strong> Jane is my cousin. / She is my cousin.</p>
        <p><strong>Incorrect:</strong> Her scarf it is pretty.</p>
        <p><strong>Correct:</strong> Her scarf is pretty. / It is pretty.</p>
    </div>
    <p>Jane and she should not be used as subjects together. The subject her scarf should not be used together with it. Use only a noun or a pronoun to name a subject.</p>
    <p><br></p>

    <h6>2. Pronouns and Their Antecedents</h6>
    <div><br></div>
    <p>The antecedent of a pronoun is a noun or another pronoun for which the pronoun stands. A personal pronoun is used in place of a noun, and the noun is the word to which the pronoun refers; it is therefore its antecedent.</p>
    <p>The noun usually comes first, either in the same sentence or in the sentence before it.</p>
    <div class="examples">
        <p>We met Mureithi. He is the medical doctor. (He stands for Mureithi. Mureithi is the antecedent.)</p>
        <p>The students had come to school with their mobile phones. (Their stands for students. Students is the antecedent.)</p>
    </div>
    <p>Pronouns may be the antecedents of other pronouns.</p>
    <div class="examples">
        <p>Does everybody have his booklet? (Everybody, which is a singular indefinite pronoun, is the antecedent of his.)</p>
        <p>All of the students have brought theirs. (All, which is a plural indefinite pronoun, is the antecedent of theirs.)</p>
    </div>
    <p>A pronoun must agree with its antecedent in number. Agree here means that the pronoun must be the same in number as its antecedent. The word number means singular or plural.</p>
    <div class="examples">
        <p><strong>Correct:</strong> The scientists tested their new discovery. (Scientists is plural; their is plural.)</p>
        <p><strong>Incorrect:</strong> The scientists tested his new discovery.</p>
        <p><strong>Correct:</strong> Mr. Kiama turned on his TV. (Mr Kiama is singular; his is singular.)</p>
        <p><strong>Correct:</strong> Nobody left her workstation. (Nobody is singular; her is singular.)</p>
    </div>
    <p><strong>NB:</strong> When the antecedent refers to both males and females, it is best to use the phrase his or her.</p>
    <p><br></p>

    <h6>3. Use of We and Us with Nouns</h6>
    <div><br></div>
    <p>Phrases such as we students and us girls are often incorrectly used. To tell which pronoun to use, drop the noun and say the sentence without it.</p>
    <div class="examples">
        <p><strong>Problem:</strong> (We, Us) boys study hard.</p>
        <p><strong>Solution:</strong> We study hard. = We boys study hard.</p>
        <p><strong>Problem:</strong> The DC praised. (us, we) students.</p>
        <p><strong>Solution:</strong> The DC praised us. = The DC praised us students.</p>
        <p><br></p>
    </div>

    <h6>4. Using the Pronoun Them</h6>
    <div><br></div>
    <p>The word <strong>them</strong> is always a pronoun. It is always used as the object of a verb or a preposition, never as a subject.</p>
    <div class="examples">
        <p><strong>Correct:</strong> The president greeted them. (Direct object of the verb greeted)</p>
        <p><strong>Correct:</strong> She gave them a sandwich. (Indirect object of the verb gave)</p>
        <p><strong>Correct:</strong> The information was useful to them. (Object of the preposition to)</p>
        <p><strong>Incorrect:</strong> Them they arrived late.</p>
        <p><br></p>
    </div>

    <h6>5. Using Those</h6>
    <div><br></div>
    <p>Although we previously said that <strong>those</strong> is used as a demonstrative pronoun, it is sometimes used as an adjective, i.e., a word that modifies a noun or a pronoun. If a noun appears immediately after it, <strong>those</strong> is now an adjective, not a pronoun.</p>
    <div class="examples">
        <p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
        <p>Those are the new desks that were bought. (Those is a pronoun, the subject of the verb are.)</p>
        <p>Those desks are attractive. (Those is an adjective modifying the noun desks.)</p>
