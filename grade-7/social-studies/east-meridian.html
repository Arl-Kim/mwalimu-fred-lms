    <h5>Calculating time of places found to the east of Greenwich Meridian</h5>
        <h6>Example 1</h6>
            <p>The time in Accra 0 ̊ is 7.00am.calculate time in bermbera 45  ̊E</p>
            <p>1hr =15  ̊</p>
            <p>? = 45 ̊ 
            <p> 45÷15×1 =3hrs</p>
            <p><strong id="tolight">So 3hrs is equivalent to 45  ̊ then add 3hrs   to 7.00am to get 10.00am</strong></p>
        <h6>Example 2</h6>
            <p>Suppose the time at GWM is 12 noon what is the local time at Watamu 40◦E?</p>
            <p><strong id="tolight">Time gained</strong>=40×4=160min=2 hours 40min</p>
            <p><strong id="tolight">Local time at Watamu is</strong> 12.00+2.40=14.40-1200=2.40pm.</p>
        <h6>Example 3</h6>
            <p>At Dar-es-Salaam 40◦E time is 12pm what is the time at Ecuador 40◦E?</p>
            <p>40◦+20◦=60◦</p>
            <p>60×4=240min=4hours</p>
            <p><strong id="tolight">Ecuador is behind in time =12.00-4=8 am.</strong></p>
            <p><strong id="togreen">NB</strong></p>
            <p><strong id="togreen">When calculating time to the east of Greenwich meridian, we add the time difference to the local time.</strong></p>
