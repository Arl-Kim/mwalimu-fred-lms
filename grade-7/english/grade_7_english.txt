ENGLISH GRADE 8 TO BE ALIGNED TO GRADE G7
WEEK 1
PARTS OF SPEECH
    All words may be classified into groups called parts of speech. There are 8 parts of speech namely: Nouns, pronouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, prepositions, conjunctions and interjections.
    We shall now discuss these parts of speech one at a time:
NOUNS
    A noun is the part of speech that names a person, a place, a thing or an idea. You use nouns every day when you speak or write. Every day you probably use thousands of nouns. Because nouns name the objects and people and places around you, it would be very difficult to talk about anything at all without them. 
    Many nouns name things you can see:
Persons	Places	Things
boy	lake	boot	
student	country	shadow
John Kamau	Nairobi	chair
stranger	Jupiter	sweater
writer	Kenyatta Market	calendar
Barack Obama	Sierra Leone	short story
	Some nouns name things you cannot see such as feelings, ideas and characteristics:
Feelings	Ideas	Characteristics
excitement	freedom	curiosity
fear	justice	cowardice
anger	fantasy	courage
happiness	faith	imagination
surprise	evil	self-confidence
Exercise 1
What words in each sentence below are nouns?
Example: John is a dancer - John, dancer
1. The students planned a party.
2. Three boys performed songs.
3. Excitement filled the air.
4. Joyce Chepkemoi won a prize.
5. Otieno lives in a house on my street.
Exercise 2
Copy the nouns below and write whether it names a person, a place, a thing, or an idea.
Example: river - place
1. Candle	5. Guitar
2. Wrestle	6. China
3. Joy	7. Hatred
4. Menengai Crater	8. Masanduku Arap Simiti

Exercise 3
Write down each noun in the following sentences.
Example:  Kenya is a beautiful country - Kenya, country
1. The musicians played drums and trumpets.
2. Her family lives in a village.
3. Petronilla enjoyed the trip.
4. A festival was held in Kenyatta University.
5. People in costumes filled the streets.
6. Boys in Scouts uniforms were leading the parade.
7. The holiday was a great excitement.
8. A taxi brought the family to the airport.
9. Maryanne built a huge castle in the wet sand.
10. Her mother swam in the warm water.
There are different kinds of nouns:
 Common and proper nouns
   All nouns can be described as either common or proper. When you talk or write about a person, a place, a thing, or an idea in general, you use a common noun.
Example: Doctors work hard. They treat many patients.
   A proper noun is the name of a particular person, place, thing, or idea. Proper nouns always begin with capital letters.
Example: Ephraim Maree is a doctor. He comes from Kirinyaga.
Note: When a proper noun is made up of more than one word, only the important words in the noun will begin with a capital letter. Do not capitalize words such as the, of, or for.
Example: Gulf of Mexico, Statue of Liberty, the Commander-in-Chief.
Common and Proper Nouns
Common            Proper                   Common            Proper 
street                 Kerugoya                city                    Raila Odinga
author               South Africa            ocean               Wanjohi 
policeman         Asia	bed                    Moi Avenue
country              Indian Ocean	wardrobe          Lake Victoria
mountain           England	continent          Dr. Frank Njenga
lake                     Mandela	assistant            Professor Saitoti
Proper nouns are important to good writing. They make your writing more specific, and therefore clearer.

   A plural noun names more than one person, place, thing or idea.
Example: The farmers drove to the markets in their trucks.
Rules for forming plurals
     The following are guidelines for forming plurals:
1. To form the plural of most singular nouns, add -s.
Examples: Street-streets, house-houses, painter-painters, shelter-shelters, event-events, hospital-hospitals.
2. When a singular noun ends in s, sh, ch, x, or z, add -es.
Examples: dress-dresses, brush-brushes, axe-axes, coach-coaches, box-boxes, bench-benches, dish-dishes, waltz-waltzes.
3. When a singular noun ends in o, add -s to make it plural.
Examples: Piano-pianos, solo-solos, cameo-cameos, concerto-concertos, patio-patios, studio-studios, radio-radios, rodeo-rodeos.
4. For some nouns ending with a consonant and o, add -es.
Examples: hero-heroes, potato-potatoes, echo-echoes, veto-vetoes, tomato-tomatoes.
5. When a singular noun ends with a consonant and y, change the y to i and add -es.
Examples: Library - libraries, activity - activities, story - stories, city - cities, berry - berries.
6. When a singular noun ends with a vowel (a,e,i,o,u) followed by y, just add  -s.
Examples: Valley - valleys, essay - essays, alley - alleys, survey - surveys, joy - joys.
7. To form the plural of many nouns ending in f or fe, change the f to v and add -es or s.
Examples: Wife - wives, thief - thieves, loaf - loaves, half - halves, shelf - shelves, leaf - leaves, scarf - scarves, life - lives, calf - calves, elf - elves.
8. For some nouns ending in f, add -s to form the plural.
Examples:  proof - proofs, belief - beliefs, motif - motifs, cliff - cliffs.
9. Some nouns remain the same in the singular and the plural.
Examples: deer - deer, sheep - sheep, series - series, species - species, moose - moose, trout - trout.
10. The plurals of some nouns are formed in special ways.
Examples: foot - feet, child - children, mouse - mice, man - men, woman - women, ox-oxen, tooth - teeth.
	 NB: If you don't figure out the correct spelling of a plural noun, look it up in a dictionary.

Examples:
commander(s)-in-chief      sergeant(s)-at-arms
mother(s)-in-law                  sister(s)-in-law

Possessive Nouns
   A possessive noun shows who or what owns something. A possessive noun can either be singular or plural.
Singular possessive nouns
   A singular possessive noun shows that one person, place, or thing has or owns something. To make a singular noun show possession, add an apostrophe and s ('s).
Example:
 the feathers of the chick - the chick's feathers
 the hat that belongs to the man - the man's hat 
Other examples:
the child's toy                  the fish's fins
Mark's bike                       the horse's tail
   Using possessive nouns is shorter and better than other ways of showing possession.
Example:
LONGER: The dog belonging to Papa is barking.
BETTER: Papa's dog is barking.
Plural Possessive Nouns
   A plural possessive noun shows possession or ownership of a plural noun.
Example: 
The cars that belong to the teachers are parked here.
The teachers' cars are parked here.
   When a plural noun ends in s, add only an apostrophe after the s to make the noun show possession.
   Not all plural nouns end in s. When a plural noun does not end in s, add 's to form the plural possession.
Examples: 
the shoes of the men - the men's shoes
the food of the children - the children's food
   The noun following a possessive noun may either be the name of a thing or a quality.
Example: 
Thing    -     Koki's raincoat          Brian's umbrella
Quality -     the judge's fury        Bob's courage
 Exercise 8
Change the following phrases to show possession in a shorter way.
Example: the claws of the leopard
	the leopard's claws.
1. the tail of the lion
2. the dog that Cliff has
3. the hat of my mother
4. the book that Evans owns
5. the pot that the child has
6. the name of the doll
7. the mobile phone that Lucy owns
8. the shoes that Kimani has
9. the teeth that the fox has
10. the rabbit that my friend owns
Summary of rules of forming Possessive Nouns
1. For singular a noun, add an apostrophe and s.
Example: Mr. Mukui's car is a Toyota Corolla.
2. For plural noun ending in s, add an apostrophe only.
Example: The victims' property was stolen
3. For a plural noun that does not end in s, add an apostrophe and s.
Example: The women's boots were muddy.
Singular Noun    Singular possessive      Plural Noun       Plural possessive
boy	boy's	              boys	boys'
child	child's	children	children's
mouse	mouse's	mice	mice's
deer	deer's	deer	deer's
Exercise 9
Write the following phrases to show possession.
Example: teachers - pens    = teachers' pens
1. cooks - aprons                6. women - sports
2. men - boots                     7. carpenters - nails
3. countries - flags              8. sailors - uniforms
4. guests - coats                  9. musicians - instruments

WEEK 2
PRONOUNS
   A pronoun is a part of speech that takes the place of a noun. They include such words as I, we, he, she, they, me and us.
   Pronouns enable you to avoid repeating the same names (nouns), when writing or speaking, which would otherwise make you sound very awkward and wordy. By using pronouns effectively, you can make your writing and speaking flow smoothly.
      Pronouns can be classified into 6 types. These are personal, indefinite, demonstrative, interrogative, reflexive and intensive pronouns.
Personal pronouns
   A personal pronoun is a word that is used in place of a noun or another pronoun. They are used to refer to nouns that name persons or things.
Example:
Awkward: 	Kamau put on Kamau's gum boots. Then Kamau went to the shamba.
Improved:	Kamau put on his gum boots. Then he went to the shamba.
   In the above example, the personal pronoun his helps the writer avoid repeating the same noun. The pronoun he acts as a bridge to connect the two sentences.
   Personal pronouns are further classified in terms of person and gender.
Person
   In terms of person, personal pronouns can be divided into three classes.
(i) First person - I, my, me, we, our and us.
   These ones refer to the person(s) speaking.
Example: I always ride my bike to school.
(ii) Second person - you, your, yours
   These refer to the person(s) spoken to.
Example:  I will call you tomorrow.
    (iii) Third person - he, his, him, she, hers, her, it, its, they, their, them. 
   These ones refer to another person(s) or thing(s) that is being spoken of.
   The personal pronoun it usually replaces a noun that stands for a thing or an animal. It is never used in place of a person.
   
   
Gender
   Personal pronouns can also be classified by gender. Gender can either be masculine (referring to male people), feminine (referring to female people) or neuter (referring to animals or things).
Examples:
Joseph cleaned his car. (his is the third person, masculine gender).
Isabel said the dress was hers (hers is the third person, feminine gender).
The dog wagged its tail. (its is the third person, neuter gender).
FORMS OF PERSONAL PRONOUNS
   In English, personal pronouns have three forms: the subject form, the object form and the possessive form.
Examples:
She is a painter. (subject form)
He praised her. (Object form)
It is her best painting. (Possessive form)
Subject Pronouns
   A subject pronoun takes the place of a noun as the subject of a sentence. These pronouns are:
(i) Singular forms - I, you, he, she, it
(ii) Plural forms - we, you, they
Examples:
Noun	 Subject Pronoun
The housegirl takes care of her.     She takes care of her.
The dog guards the house.	 It guards the house.
Mark and Francis love swimming. They love swimming.
   Subject pronouns also appear after forms of the linking verbs be.
Examples:
The watchman today is he.
The composers were they.
Exercise 1
Underline the subject pronouns in the following sentences.
Example: She ate a water melon
1. They ate fish and chips.
2. We like Italian food.
3. It is delicious.
4. The biggest eater was he.
5. You helped in the cooking.
6. The cooks were Tom and I.

Exercise 2
Replace the underlined words with subject pronouns.
Example: Pio and Gama are friends - They
1. The glasses were under the table.
2. Emma fed the chicken.
3. The pears were juicy.
4. Uncle Ben and Lillian visited the orphans.
5. The new waitress is Jane.
6. The fastest runners were Tecla and Kirui.
7. Lisa went to the hall.
8. The chicken was slaughtered.
9. Lucky Dube and Brenda Fasie were South African Singers.
10. Samuel Wanjiru has won many athletics medals.
Object pronouns
       Object pronouns can replace nouns used after action verbs. These pronouns are:
(i) Singular - me, you, him, her, it
(ii)  Plural - us, you, them
Examples:
The driver drove him. (Direct object)
The parents thanked us. (Direct object)
The reporters asked him many questions. (Indirect object)
   In the above examples, the personal pronouns are the direct or indirect objects of the verbs before them.
   Object pronouns can also replace nouns after prepositions such as to, for, with, in, at or by. That is, they can be objects of prepositions.
Examples:
Gladys waved to them. (Object of a preposition)
The delivery is for me.
Ben went with them to the theatre.
Exercise 3
Choose the correct pronoun in the brackets in the following sentences.
Example: Irungu photographed (us, we). = us
1. Lisa asked (he, him) for a picture.
2. Adam sketched Lisa and (I, me).
3. He gave a photo to (us, we).
4. Ann and (she, her) saw Dave and Bob.
5. Adam drew Lisa and (they, them).
6. Mark helped (I, me) with the packing.
7. Loise praised (him, he) for his good work.
8. Everyone spotted (they, them) easily.
9. That night Mike played the guitar for (us, we).
10. (We, Us) drove with (they, them) to the mountains.
Possessive pronouns
   A possessive pronoun shows ownership.
Example: My pen is black.
   There are two kinds of possessive pronouns:
i. Those used as adjectives to modify nouns. These possessive pronouns are:
Singular: My, your, his, her, its
Plural: Our, your, their
Examples: 
My shirt is yellow.             Your food is on the table.
His bag is green.                 This is her dress.
Its fur is soft.                       These are our parents.
Pay your bills.                     They removed their bats. 
	The above possessive pronouns always appear before nouns to modify them. Hence, they are called modifiers.
ii. Those that stand alone and replace nouns in sentences. These possessive nouns are:
Singular: mine, yours, his, hers, its
Plural: ours, yours, their
Examples: 
The yellow shirt is mine.     The food on the table is yours.
The green bag is his.            This dress is hers.
Its is the soft fur.                  These crops are ours.
These bills are yours.           Those hats are theirs.

8. Micere is excited that the idea was (her, hers).
9. Koki and Toti cannot hide (their, theirs) excitement.
10. (My, mine) dream is to climb to the highest peak of the mountain. 
POINTS TO NOTE
1. The pronoun I is used as a subject or after forms of the linking verb be.
Examples: 
Subject: I travel by bus.
After the linking verb be: Yesterday, the prefects on duty were Victor and I.
2. The pronoun me is used as an object after action verbs or words (prepositions) such as to, for, with, in, or at.
Examples:
Object: Rose met me at the gate.
After prepositions: Rose waited for me at the gate.
	 You are coming with me.
3. When using compound subjects and objects (i.e. subjects and objects comprising of a pronoun and a noun or another pronoun), always name yourself last.
Examples:
Diana and I visited our grandmother yesterday.
Who appointed Chege and me?
Rose waited for her and me at the gate.
CONTRACTIONS WITH PRONOUNS
   A contraction is a shortened form of two words. One or more letters are omitted and an apostrophe (') is used in place of the letters left out.
   A contraction is formed by combining pronouns and the verbs am, is, are, will, would, have, has, and had.
Pronoun + verb Contraction Pronoun + verb	Contraction
I am	I'm	I have	I've
He is 	he's	he has	he's
It is	it's	it has	it's
You are 	you're	you have	you've
They are 	they're	they have	they've
I will	I'll	I had	I'd
You will	you'll	you had	you'd
We would	we'd	we had	we'd
Note: 
1.Some contractions look the same but are formed from different words.
Examples: 
he is, he has = he's
we had, we would = we'd
2.Some possessive pronouns sound like contractions. Because the words sound alike, they are sometimes confused.
Examples:
Possessive pronouns	Contractions	
         its	it's
your	you're
their	they're
whose	who's
Incorrect: The team celebrated it's victory.
Correct: The team celebrated its victory.
Incorrect: Your late for the preps.
Correct: You're late for the preps.
Incorrect: Whose the fastest runner in the world?
Correct: Who's the fastest runner in the world?
Rules of using possessive pronouns and contractions correctly:
1. If the word you want to use stands for two words, it is a contraction and needs an apostrophe.
2. Never use an apostrophe in a possessive pronoun.
Exercise 5
Write the contractions for the following word pairs. Example: It has = it's
1. You will 	3. He had			5. You have
     2. We would 	4. I am	    			6. They will
Exercise 6
What pronoun and verb make up each of the following contractions?
Example: It's = it is, it has
     1. I'll	3. you'd			5. they're
     2. we're	4. he's			6. she'd
Exercise 7
Choose the correct word given in brackets in the following sentences.
1. The Kenyan government has worked hard to improve (its, it's) educational system.
2. (Whose, Who's) going to decide where the guests will sleep?
3. (Their, They're) learning French in their school.
4. Only students (whose, who's) scores are excellent will join national schools.
5. (Its, It's) been estimated that about 8 million Kenyans are living with HIV AIDS.

INDEFINITE PRONOUNS
   An indefinite pronoun is a pronoun that does not refer to a specific person or thing.
   In English, there are singular indefinite pronouns, plural indefinite and both singular and plural indefinite pronouns.
Singular Indefinite Pronouns
another	anything	everybody	 neither	one
anybody	each	everyone	 nobody	somebody
anymore	either	everything	 no one	someone.
   An indefinite pronoun must agree with its verbs and in number with its possessive pronoun. The above indefinite pronouns are used with singular verbs. They are also used with singular possessive pronouns.
Examples:
Agreement with verbs
Correct: Everyone has heard of Lake Turkana.
Incorrect: Everyone have heard of Lake Turkana.
Correct: Nobody knows what happened to Samuel Wanjiru.
Incorrect: Nobody know what happened to Samuel Wanjiru.
Correct: Everything about the old man remains a mystery.
Incorrect: Everything about the old man remain a mystery.
Agreement in number with possessive pronouns
Correct: Neither believed his/her eyes.
Incorrect: Neither believed their eyes.
Correct: Each strained his/her neck to see.
Incorrect: Each strained their neck to see.
Plural indefinite pronouns
both	       many	             few                several
   These indefinite pronouns use plural verbs and possessive pronouns.
Examples:
Plural verbs
Correct: Few know about Lake Olbolosat.
Incorrect: Few knows about Lake Obolosat.
Correct: Both stand by what they believe.
Incorrect: Both stands by what they believe.
 Plural possessive pronouns
Correct: Several reported their findings.
Incorrect: Several reported his/her findings.
Both singular and plural indefinite pronouns
all                some                any                    none
   These indefinite pronouns may be singular or plural, depending on their meaning in the sentence.
Examples:
All of my story is true. - singular
All of the guests are here. - plural
None of the lake is foggy. - singular
None of the photos are spoiled. - plural.
EXERCISE 8
Underline the indefinite pronouns in the following sentences and then write the correct form of the verb or possessive pronoun in the brackets.
1. All the photographs of the killer (is, are) unclear.
2. (Has, Have) anybody seen my camera?
3. Many (believes, believe) a monster lives in the lake.
4. Each of the photographs (make, makes) people want more.
5. All of the evidence (indicates, indicate) that he was killed by his wife.
6. Everyone has taken (his, their) payment.

8. Anyone can lose (her, their) eyesight.
9. Another reported (his, their) case to the police.
10. Somebody left (her, their) handbag in the lecture hall.
DEMONSTRATIVE PRONOUNS
   A demonstrative pronoun is used to single or point out one or more persons or things referred to in the sentence. These pronouns are this, that, these, and those.
   This and these point to persons or things that are near.
Examples:
This is a gazelle.
These are the students of Kianjege West Secondary School.
   That and those point to persons or things that are farther away.
Examples:
That is the city square.
Those are the lodging rooms.
   This and that are used with singular nouns. These and those are used with plural nouns.
Exercise 9
Pick the correct demonstrate pronouns from the choices given in the brackets in the following sentences.
1. (This, That) is the canteen we are entering now.
2. (This, That) is the dispensary across the street
3. (These, Those) are beautiful flowers on the counter over there.
4. Are (those, these) chocolate bars on the far counter?
5. I think (these, those) are called Vuvuzelas.
INTERROGATIVE PRONOUNS
   An interrogative pronoun is used to ask a question. These pronouns are who, whose, whom, which and what.
Examples:
Who is the mayor of this town?
Whose is the red car?
Which is her blouse?
What did she ask you?
Whom should I trust with my secret?
USING WHO, WHOM, AND WHOSE
   Who, whom, and whose are often used to ask questions. Hence, they are interrogative pronouns.
   WHO is the subject form. It is used as the subject of a verb.
Examples:
Who taught you how to play the guitar? (Who is the subject of the verb taught.)
   WHOM is the object form. It is used as the direct object of a verb or as the object of a preposition.
Examples:
Whom did you meet? (Whom is the object of the verb did meet).
For whom is this trophy? (whom is the object of the preposition for).
   WHOSE is the possessive form. It can be used :
(i) To modify a noun
Example:
Whose umbrella is this? (whose modifies the noun umbrella)
(ii)  Alone as the subject or object of a verb 
Examples:
Whose are those water melons? (whose is the subject of the verb are)
Whose did you admire? (whose is the object of the verb did admire)
Exercise 10
Pick the correct interrogative pronouns from the brackets in the following sentences.
1. (Who, Whom) owns that shop?
2. (Who, Whom) can we ask the way?
3. (Which, What) did they ask you?
4. (Which, What) are the objects on the table called?
5. To (who, whom) does the boutique belong?

7. _________________ skill in dancing is the best?
8. _________________ is the officer-in-charge here?
9. _________________ are you looking at?
10._________________ are those healthy Merino sheep?
REFLEXIVE AND INTENSIVE PRONOUNS
   Reflexive and intensive pronouns end in -self or -selves. These are myself, yourself, herself, himself, itself, ourselves, and themselves. There is, however, one difference between reflexive and Intensive pronouns.
   A reflexive pronoun refers to an action performed by the subject of the sentence. The meaning of the sentence is incomplete without the reflexive pronoun.
Examples:
Monicah bought herself a new dress. 
(The meaning of the sentence is incomplete without the reflexive pronoun because we do not know for whom Monicah bought the dress).
   An Intensive pronoun is used to emphasise a noun or a pronoun. It does not add information to a sentence, and it can be removed without changing the meaning of the sentence.
I myself pulled the boy out of the river.
(If you remove myself, the meaning of the sentence does not change)
Exercise 12
Identify the Reflexive and Intensive pronouns in the following sentences, labelling them accordingly.
1. I myself have never tried mountain climbing.
2. He himself was taking the cows to graze in the forest.
3. My sister Annastasia mends her clothes herself.
4. She often challenges herself by doing strenuous activities.
5. You may ask yourself about the sanity of beer drinking competition.

SPECIAL PRONOUNS PROBLEMS
     1. Double subjects
   We all know that every sentence must have a subject. Sometimes we incorrectly use a double subject - a noun and a pronoun - to name the same person, place, or thing.
     Incorrect	      Correct
Jane she is my cousin.	Jane is my cousin.
		She is my cousin.
Her scarf it is pretty.	Her scarf is pretty.	
		It is pretty.
Jane and she should not be used as subjects together.
The subject her scarf should not be used together with it.
Use only a noun or a pronoun to name a subject.
     2. Pronouns and their Antecedents
   The antecedent of a pronoun is a noun or another pronoun for which the pronoun stands.
   A personal pronoun, you will remember, is used in place or a noun. The noun is the word to which the pronouns refer and it is therefore its antecedent.
   The noun usually comes first, either in the same sentence or in the sentence before it.
Examples:
We met Mureithi. He is the medical doctor.
(He stands for Mureithi. Mureithi is the antecedent).
The students had come to school with their mobile phones.
(Their stands for students. Students is the antecedent).
   Pronouns may be the antecedents of other pronouns.
Examples:
Does everybody have his booklet?
(everybody, which is a singular indefinite pronoun, is the antecedent of his).
All of the students have brought theirs.
(All, which is a plural indefinite pronoun, is the antecedent of theirs).
   Now, a pronoun must agree with its antecedent in number. Agree here means that the pronoun must be the same in number as its antecedent. The word number means singular or plural.
   If the pronoun is singular, the word that it stands for must be singular, and it must be plural if the word it stands for is plural.
Examples:
Correct:     The scientists tested their new discovery.
               (Scientists is plural; their is plural.)
Incorrect:  The scientists tested his new discovery.
Correct:     Mr. Kiama turned on his TV.
	          (Mr Kiama is singular; his is singular)
Correct:     Nobody left her workstation.
	    (Nobody is singular, her is singular)
NB: When the antecedent refers to both males and females, it is best to use the phrase his or her.
3. Use of we and us with nouns.
   Phrases such as we students and us girls are often incorrectly used. To tell which pronoun to use, drop the noun and say the sentence without it.
Problem: (We, Us) boys study hard.	
Solution: We study hard. = We boys study hard.
Problem: The DC praised. (us, we) students.
Solution: The DC praised us. = The DC praised us students
4. Using the pronoun Them
The word them is always a pronoun. It is always used as the object of a verb or a preposition, never as a subject.
Examples:
Correct: The president greeted them. (direct object of the verb greeted)
Correct: She gave them a sandwich. (Indirect object of the verb gave)
Correct: The information was useful to them. (object of the preposition to)
Incorrect: Them they arrived late.
5. Using Those
Although we previously said that those is used as a demonstrative pronouns, it is sometimes used as an adjective i.e. a word that modifies a noun or a pronoun. If a noun appears immediately after it, those is now an adjective, not a pronoun.
Examples:
Those are the new desks that were bought. (Those is a pronoun, the subject of the verb are).
Those desks are attractive. (Those is an adjective modifying the noun desks).
Exercise 13
    Each of the following sentences has a double subject. Write each correctly.
1. Papa Shirandula he is a good actor.
2. Many people they find him funny.
3. The show it was on television for many years.
4. Their daughter she is also in that show.
5. The shoes they are beautiful.
6. People they like our hotel.
7. My brother he drives a matatu.
8. Our hotel it is open seven days a week.
9. The TV it is very clear today.
10. My brother and sister they work in Nairobi.
Exercise 14
Pick the correct pronoun in the brackets in the following sentences.
1. (We, Us) students started a school magazine last month.
2. Many careers are unpromising. (Them, Those) are the ones to avoid.
3. One of (them, those) motivational speakers was especially interesting.
4. A financial analyst told (we, us) students about his work.
5. Finding jobs was important to (we, us) graduates.









WEEK 3
VERBS
   A verb is a word that:
(i) expresses  an action
(ii)  expresses the state that something exists, or 
(iii) links the subject with a word that describes or renames it.
   Hence, there are two kinds of verbs. These are action verbs and linking verbs.
ACTION VERBS
       Action verbs express actions. They show what the subject does or did. Most verbs are action verbs.
Examples:
Cats drink milk.
The ball flew over the goal post.
The farmer tills the land.
Robert ran to the house.
   The action may be one that you can see.
Example:
They crowned their new King.
   The action may be one that you cannot see.
Example:
She wanted recognition.
   Whether the action can be seen or not, an action verb says that something is happening, has happened, or will happen.
LINKING VERBS
A linking verb links the subject of a sentence with a word or words that :
(i) express(es) the subject's state of being
Example:
She is here. (expresses state of being)
She seems ready. (state of being)
(ii)  describe(s) or rename(s) the subject.
Examples:
Anna is a nurse. (a nurse describes Anna)
Joyce is cheerful. (cheerful describes Joyce)
The road is bumpy.	(bumpy describes the road)
   A linking verb does not tell about an action.
Common linking verbs
Am         look	grow          are	    feel	  remain
is	taste	become     was	    smell     sound
were	seem	will             be	    appear
NB: Some verbs can be either linking verbs or action verbs.
Examples:
The crowd looked at the mangled car. - ACTION
The driver of the car looked shocked. - LINKING
The chef smelled the food. - ACTION
The food smelled wonderful. - LINKING
EXERCISE 1
Identify the verb in each of the following sentences. Then label each verb Action or Linking.
1. Queen Elizabeth of England seems an interesting historical figure.
2. We watched the Olympic games on television.
3. The crowd cheered loudly.
4. She seems calm.
5. PLO Lumumba is a quick thinker.
6. The hunter aimed the arrow at the antelope.
7. The referee blew the whistle to start off the game.
8. She was very tired after the journey.
9. She is careful when crossing the road.
10. The country seems prosperous.
VERB PHRASES
    In some sentences, the verb is more than one word. It is in form of a phrase, which is called a verb phrase. A verb phrase consists of a main verb and one or more helping verbs. The main verb shows the action in the sentence.
The helping verb works with the main verb. Helping verbs do not show action.
Examples:
Mark Francis has passed the examinations.
	          H.V.  M.V.
He will be admitted to a national school.
      H.V.H.V.  M.V.
His parents are happy with him.
	       H.V. M.V.
Common helping verbs
am	will      can      would    is       shall	could	
must      are      have     may    was      has	should
were 	had      might
   Some verbs, such as do, have and be can either be used as main verbs or as helping verbs.
Examples:
As main verbs	                   As helping verbs
I will do the job.	                   I do like the job.
Who has a pen?	                   He has lost his pen.
They are my friends.	          They are coming today.
   Sometimes helping verbs and main verbs are separated by words that are not verbs.
Examples:
I do not ride a bicycle any more.
Can we ever be friends again?
We should definitely apologise for the mistakes.
Exercise 2
Indicate H.V. under the Helping verb and M.V. under the Main verb in the following sentences.
1. The school choir is singing a new song.
2. The football season has finally begun.
3. This car just can travel very fast.
4. He had waited for this chance for years.
5. My parents will be visiting us soon.
6. Our friends have come for a visit.
7. You must buy your ticket for the game.
8. Sarah has chosen Kenyatta University for her degree course.
9. She is hitting her child with a rubber strap.
10. I will go for the game next week.
VERBS TENSES
   The time of an action or the state of being is expressed by different forms of the verb. These forms are called the tenses of the verb.
   There are three main forms of a verb: the present, the past, or the future.
The Present Tense
   A verb which is in present tense indicates what the subject of the sentence is doing right now.
Example:
The teacher sees the students.
The verb sees tells that the teacher is seeing the students now. To show the present tense, an -s or -es is added to most verbs if the subject is singular.
   If the subject is plural, or I or You, the -s, or -es is not added.
Examples:
The bird hatches in the nest.
The stream flows down the hill.
The boys rush for their breakfast.
We talk a lot.
Rules for forming the Present Tense with Singular Subjects
1. Most verbs: add -s      
get - gets          play - plays          eat - eats
2. Verbs ending in s, ch, sh, x, and z: add -es 
pass - passes                             mix - mixes                                                                        punch-punches                         buzz - buzzes	                                                                          push - pushes
3. Verbs ending with a consonant and y: change the y to i and add -es                                
try - tries                           empty - empties

2. A fish _______________ in the water near me. (splash)
3. She _______________ her hands. (wash)
4. He ______________ to the classroom. (hurry)
5. Bryan and I ____________ the assignment. (discuss)
The Past Tense
   A verb which is in past tense shows what has already happened.
Example:
Tito liked his grandmother's story.
   The verb liked tells that the action in the sentence happened before now.
Rules for forming the Past Tense
1. Most verbs: Add  -ed	play - played
		talk - talked
		climb - climbed
2. Verbs ending with e: Add -d	praise - praised
                  	hope - hoped
		wipe - wiped
3. Verbs ending with a consonant and -y: Change the y to i and add -ed                                            bury - buried  
                                                                   carry - carried
		study - studied
4. Verbs ending with a single vowel and a consonant: Double the final consonant and add-ed	 stop - stopped
	                                                      man - manned
	                                                      trip - tripped

The Future Tense
   A verb which is in future tense tells what is going to happen.
Examples:
Evans will take his car to the garage.
She will probably come with us.
   The verbs will take and will come tell us what is going to happen. Hence, they are in future tense.
       To form the future tense of a verb, use the helping verb will or shall  with the main verb.
Exercise 5
Write the future tense forms of the verbs in the following sentences.
1. We write in exercise books.
2. The train stopped at the station.
3. He decides what he wants to do.
4. They practise in the football field.
5. Rats multiply very fast.
More Tenses
   The above three forms of tenses can further be divided into:
1. The simple tenses 	- Present simple tense
		- Past simple tense
		- Future simple tense
2. The perfect tenses                - Present perfect tense
                                                  - Present perfect progressive	                                                  - Past perfect tense

3. The progressive tenses	- Present progressive tense
	- Past progressive tense
	- Progressive tense
	- Future perfect progressive tense.
The simple Tenses
   The most common tenses of the verb are the simple tenses. You use them most often in your speaking and writing.
1. Present simple tense.
Look at the following sentences.
(a) I know Kisumu.
(b) He goes to school every day.
(c) The sun rises from the east.
   All the above sentences contain a verb in the present simple tense. This tense is used for different purposes.
(i) To state a personal fact
          Example: I know Kisumu.
     (ii) To point out a regular habit.
          Example: He goes to school every day.
     (iii) To state a known scientific fact

She will eat the bananas alone.
The dancers will entertain them.
Exercise 8
Use the following words in future simple tense in sentences of your own.
see	                        develop

exist	                        consume
introduce	                        hunt
bring 	                        become
The Perfect Tenses
     The perfect tenses are used to show that an action was completed or that a condition existed before a given time. The perfect tenses are formed using has, have, or had before the past participles, that is, verb forms ending in -ed.
Examples: 
1. Present Perfect Tense: 
   Ceasar has just finished his homework. 
   Kamau and Njoroge have now agreed to meet.

   Nobody knew that she had already remarried.
4. Past Perfect Continuous Tense
I had been trying to contact him for two hours before he finally appeared.
Mrs. Masumbuko had been feeling unwell the whole week before she decided to visit a doctor.

Exercise 9
Rewrite the following sentence changing the verb into present perfect, present perfect progressive, past perfect, past perfect progressive, future perfect and future perfect progressive tenses. Make any necessary changes to make the sentences meaningful.
      John comes here every year.
The Progressive Verb Forms
   The progressive form of the verb shows continuing action.
Examples:
I am singing
She was dancing.
   The progressive form is formed using various forms of the verb be plus the present participle, that is, a verb form that ends in -ing.
Examples:
1. Present Progressive Tense
I am reading a book about Red Indians.
Her mother is preparing dinner.
2. Present Perfect Progressive
He has been cleaning his car since morning.
They have been exercising for a week now.
3. Past Progressive Tense
She was cooking supper when I arrived.
They were fighting fiercely when the police arrived.
4. Past Perfect Progressive Tense

        Jane plays the guitar well.
SUBJECT - VERB AGREEMENT
Present tense
   A verb and its subject must agree in number. To agree means that if the subject is singular, the verb must be in singular form. If the subject is plural, the verb form must be plural.
Examples:
The baby cries every morning. - SINGULAR
The babies cry every morning. - PLURAL
Rules for subject-verb Agreement
1. Singular subject: Add -s or -es to the verb	
The man drives a bus.
She teaches in a primary school.
He studies his map.
2. Plural subject: Do not add -s or -es to the verb
The men drive buses.
They teach in primary schools.
We study our maps.
3. For I or You: Do not add -s or -es to the verb	
I hate books.
You like dogs.
I admire actors.
   When a sentence has a compound subject, that is, two subjects joined by and, the plural form of the verb is used.
Examples:
John and James work at Naivas Supermarket.
The teachers and the students respect one another a lot.
Subject-verb Agreement with be and have
   The verbs be and have change their forms in special ways in order to agree with their subjects.

REGULAR AND IRREGULAR VERBS
   We have learned in the previous chapter how to form the past tense and how to use helping verbs to show that something has already happened. We saw that for most verbs, we form the past tense and participles by adding -d or -ed to the verb. Verbs that follow this rule are called Regular Verbs.
Examples:
The farmer planted his crops last month. - past tense
The crops have been planted recently. - past participle.
    For all regular verbs, the past and the past participles are spelled alike. They are made up by adding -d or -ed to the present form of the verb.
   
Examples:
PresentPastPast Participleshelp
rescue
rush
support
play
talk
livehelped
rescued
rushed
supported
played
talked
livedhad helped
had rescued
had rushed
had supported
had played
had talked
had lived   The spelling of many regular verbs changes when -d or -ed is added, that is, the last consonant is doubled before adding -d or -ed. For those ending -y, it is dropped and replaced with -i:
Examples:
PresentPastPast Participleshop
drug
permit
knit
cry
carryhopped
drugged
permitted
knitted
cried
carried(had) hopped
(had) drugged
(had) permitted
(had) knitted
(had) cried
(had) carriedExercise 12
Write the present, past and past participles of the following verbs. Remember to change the spelling appropriately where necessary.
1. prevent	              6. aid
2. donate	              7. relieve
3. hurry	              8. share
4. worry	              9. enrol
5. train	            10. save
Irregular Verbs
   Some verbs do not form the past by adding -d or -ed. These verbs are called irregular verbs. There are only about sixty frequently used irregular verbs. For many of these, the past and the past participles are spelled the same but some are different.
Examples:
He saw great misery all around him. - past
He has seen great misery all round him. - past participle

(had) written
(had) rung
(had) drunk
(had) lain
(had) done
(had) eaten
(had) known   For a few irregular verbs, like hit and cut, the three principal parts are spelled the same. These ones offer no problems to learners. Most problems come from irregular verbs with three different forms. For example, the irregular verbs throw and ring.
throw	               threw	              had thrown
ring	               rang	               had rung
   If you are not sure about a verb form, look it up in the dictionary.
Exercise 13
Write the past tense and past participles of the following irregular verbs and then use each of them in sentences of your own.
1. arise	                        6. fall
2. tear	                        7. blow
3. wear	                        8. freeze
4. lay		                  9. fly
5. see		                10. write
ACTIVE AND PASSIVE VERB FORMS
ACTIVE VOICE
   A verb is in active voice when the subject of the sentence performs the action.
Examples:
Our teacher punished us for making noise in class.
     Subject       action
Players arrived for their first match early in the morning.
Subject  action
   In the above sentences, the subject is who performed the action. Hence, the verbs of these sentences are in active voice.
PASSIVE VOICE  
   The word passive means "acted upon". When the subject of the sentence receives the action or expresses the result of the action, the verb is in passive voice.
Examples:
We were punished by the teacher for making noise.
Sub	       action
He was helped by a passer-by.
Sub        action                   
   In the above sentences the subjects we and he receive the action.
   When we do not know who or what did the action, or when we do not want to say who or what did it, we use the passive voice.
   The passive form of a verb consists of some form of be plus the past participle.
Examples:
       Active	                       Passive
Baabu explored the sea.	      The sea was explored by Baabu.
		                     Be + past participle
The captain helped him. 	He was helped by the captain.
	                      Be+past participle
Exercise 14
Write the verbs from the following sentences and then label each one Active or Passive.
1. The guest of honour presented prizes to the best students.
2. The cattle were taken home by the herders.
3. The health officer ordered the slaughter house closed.
4. Peace and order has been restored in the area by the youth wingers.
5. The workers cleared the farm.
6. The crop was harvested by the hired workers.
7. The government stressed the importance of unity among tribes.
8. The farmers were urged to redouble their efforts in food production.
9. The K.I.E is developing support materials for the 8-4-4 system of education.
    10. A fishing pond was started by the Wildlife Club in the school.
TRANSITIVE AND INTRANSITIVE VERBS
   Some sentences express a complete thought with only a subject and an action verb.
Example:
The sun shines.
Subject     Action verb
   In other sentences, a direct object must follow the action verb for the sentence to be complete. A direct object is a noun or a pronoun that receives the action of the verb.
Example:
The goalkeeper caught the ball.
       Subject	    action verb direct object
Transitive verbs
   A Transitive verb is an action verb that must take a direct object for the sentence to express a complete thought. A direct object answers the question what? or whom?
Examples:
The captain steered the ship. (Steered what? the ship)
The teacher praised the students. (Praised whom? The students)
   Transitive verbs cannot be used alone without direct objects in sentences; they would not have complete meanings.
Exercise 15
What are the action verbs and the direct objects in the following sentences?
1. He carried his bag with him.
2. The two friends discussed the examination paper.
3. We took a trip to Nakuru last month.
4. The water splashed me.
5. He gave interesting facts about whales.
6. We searched the house for rats.
7. They cheered the team noisily.
8. My brother bought a camera.
9. Njoroge admires Papa Shirandula.
    10. We viewed the shouting star at midnight.
Intransitive verbs
   An Intransitive verb is an action verb that does not require a direct object for the sentence to have complete meaning.
   
Examples:
The ship sailed.
Subject      action verb
The child smiled.
Subject      action verb
   They do not answer the questions what? or whom? Sometimes they answer the questions how? or how often?
Examples:
The ship sailed smoothly. (How did it sail? Smoothly)
The child smiled repeatedly. (How often did the child smile? Repeatedly)
Both transitive and intransitive verbs
   Some verbs can be used both transitively and intransitively.
Examples:
We cheered our team noisily. (Transitive)
We cheered noisily. (Intransitive)
He broke the window pane. (Transitive)
The glass broke. (Intransitive)
NB: Only transitive verbs can be changed from active to passive voice.
Examples:
Active		         Passive
He kicked the ball.		The ball was kicked by him.
She bought a new dress		A new dress was bought by her.
She wailed loudly                                      ??
They danced well                                      ??
