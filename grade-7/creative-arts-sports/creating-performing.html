    <p>To understand and be able to write rhythmic patterns dictated, one needs to follow the following tips:
        <ul>
            l<li>Establish the beat of the rhythm patterns.</li>
            <li>Clap or tap the full rhythm before you start writing.</li>
            <li>Break down the rhythm into bars and write one bar at a time while clapping the whole rhythmic pattern.</li>
            <li>Clap through the rhythmic pattern you have written to check if it conforms to the rhythm dictated.</li>
            <li>Creating involves coming up with a rhythmic pattern that has not existed before.</li>

        <ul>
            <li>Balanced - each of the four bars should have notes adding up equally as per the time signature given or selected in simple time.</li>
            <li>Unique - be as creative as possible. Explore the different note values that you have so far learnt to bring in new ideas.</li>
            <li>Simple - it should be easily performed, interpreted and memorable. Use simple note values.</li>
            <li>Variety - use different note values, tied notes, dotted notes and rests to make the pattern more interesting.</li>

        <li>Maintain the given pulse, tempo or speed.</li>
        <li>Be keen to keep it steady as the playing is going on.</li>
        <li>Tap back the played rhythm patterns as played.</li>
        <li>Sing it back using French rhythm names and memorize the pattern as played.</li>
        <li>Write out the played pattern.</li>
        <li>Listen again as you follow to confirm that what you have written is what has been played.</li><br>
        It is always important to pay keen attention to the given instructions, because from them you get the time signature and how fast the rhythm will be played.

    <h6>Improvising Rhythmic Accompaniments with Dotted Notes in Simple Time.</h6>
    <p>Improvising is creating an additional feel, in this case, a different corresponding rhythmic pattern to what is already given.
        To accompany is to play different rhythmic patterns alongside an already given rhythmic pattern. This happens spontaneously (suddenly) without practice. It should come from within oneself.
        The following are some software for the different digital applications you can install for more practice:<br>
