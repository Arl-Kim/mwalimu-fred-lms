    <h5>2.1 Faith and God’s Promises</h5>
    <h6>Background to The Call of Abraham</h6>
    <ul>
        <li>Abraham’s father was called <strong id="tolight">Terah</strong>.</li>
        <li>Abraham had a wife by the name <strong id="tolight">Sarah</strong> and a nephew called <strong id="tolight">Lot</strong>.</li>
        <li><strong id="tolight">Lot</strong> was a son to Abraham’s brother, <strong id="tolight">Haran</strong>. They were Sematic nomads from a tribe called <strong id="tolight">Amorite</strong>.</li>
        <li>They came from the ancient city of <strong id="tolight">Ur</strong>, which was near river <strong id="tolight">Euphrates</strong> in <strong id="tolight">Babylon</strong>.</li>
        <li>In <strong id="tolight">Ur</strong>, the god of moon was worshipped. There were also other gods and goddesses worshiped in the area.</li>
        <li>People gave offerings to these gods and goddesses, which sometimes included human sacrifice.</li>
        <li>At <strong id="tolight">Ur</strong>, <strong id="tolight">Haran</strong> (Lot’s father) died.</li>
        <li><strong id="tolight">Terah</strong> migrated together with Abraham, <strong id="tolight">Sarah</strong>, and his grandson, <strong id="tolight">Lot</strong>, from <strong id="tolight">Ur</strong> to <strong id="tolight">Haran</strong>.</li>
        <li><strong id="tolight">Terah</strong> later died when he was <strong id="tolight">205 years old</strong>. While at <strong id="tolight">Haran</strong>, God called Abraham at the age of <strong id="tolight">77 years</strong>. He told him to leave his country and his relatives and go to a place, which He was going to show him.</li>
    </ul>

    <h6>Ways in Which Abraham Demonstrated Faith to God</h6>
    <p>Faith is complete trust or confidence in somebody or something. Faith in God therefore means total trust and confidence in God.</p>
    <p><strong id="tolight">Hebrews 11:1-6</strong> teaches the following about faith in God:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Faith is being sure of things we hope for.</li>
        <li>To have faith is to be certain of things we cannot see.</li>
        <li>By faith we understand that God created the universe by His word.</li>
        <li>Faith helped Abel to offer an acceptable sacrifice to God as compared to Cain whose sacrifice was rejected by God.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h6>Abraham’s Demonstration of Faith</h6>
    <ul>
        <li>Abraham is referred to as the father of faith. He demonstrated faith in God in various ways as follows:</li>
        <li>Abraham obeyed God. When he was instructed by God to leave his land and people to go to an unknown land, Abraham obeyed God without questioning.</li>
        <li>Abraham obeyed God without questioning when God appeared to him and promised that He would shield him from all dangers and reward him greatly.</li>
        <li>Abraham agreed to circumcise all male members of his household.</li>
        <li>Abraham was willing to sacrifice his only son Isaac.</li>
    </ul>
