    <ul>
        <li>Movement of the earth on its own axis (imaginary line through the centre from N pole to S pole</li>
        <li>Rotates through 360º</li>
        <li>Takes 24 hours (day) to complete 1 rotation</li>

    <h6>Effects of Rotation of the Earth</h6>
    <ul>
        <ol type="1">
            <li>Creates day and night because at any one time one side of the earth faces the sun (day) and the other remains in darkness (night).</li>
            <li>Causes deflection of winds and ocean currents in the N hemisphere to the left and in the S hemisphere to the right.</li>
            <li>It causes rising and falling of ocean tides.</li>
            <li>Causes time difference between longitudes</li>

<h5>Revolution of the earth</h5>
<ul>
    <li>Movement of the earth in its orbit around the sun.</li>
    <li>It’s in anticlockwise direction.</li>
    <li>The orbit of the earth’s revolution is elliptical.</li>
    <li>Takes 365 ¼ days in a year or 366 days in a leap year (every 4 years).</li>
    <li>The sun moves from the tropic of cancer to the equator and then towards tropic of Capricorn and back to the tropic of cancer.</li>
    <li>21st march and 23rd September are called equinoxes because the length of day and night is equal. The sun is vertically overhead at noon at the equator.</li>
    <li>21st June is called summer solstice because its summer in the N hemisphere. The sun is vertically overhead at noon at the tropic of cancer.</li>
    <li>22nd December is called winter solstice because its winter in the S. hemisphere. The sun is vertically overhead at noon at noon at the tropic of Capricorn.</li>
    <li>Solstice is the period of maximum tilting of the earth towards the sun.</li>
