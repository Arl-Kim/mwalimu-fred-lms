    <h5>Verb Tenses</h5>
    <div><br></div>
    <p>The time of an action or the state of being is expressed by different forms of the verb. These forms are called the tenses of the verb.</p>
    <p>There are three main forms of a verb: the present, the past, or the future.</p>
    <p><br></p>

    <h6>The Present Tense</h6>
    <div><br></div>
    <p>A verb which is in present tense indicates what the subject of the sentence is doing right now.</p>
    <p><br></p>

    <h6>Example:</h6>
    <p><strong>The teacher sees the students.</strong></p>
    <p><strong><br></strong></p>
    <p>The verb <strong>sees</strong> tells that the teacher is seeing the students now. To show the present tense, an <strong>-s</strong> or <strong>-es</strong> is added to most verbs if the subject is singular.</p>

    <p>If the subject is plural, or <strong>I</strong> or <strong>You</strong>, the <strong>-s</strong> or <strong>-es</strong> is not added.</p>
    <p><br></p>

    <h6>Examples:</h6>
    <ul>
        <li>The bird hatches in the nest.</li>
        <li>The stream flows down the hill.</li>
        <li>The boys rush for their breakfast.</li>
        <li>We talk a lot.</li>
    </ul>
    <div><br></div>
    <ul>
    </ul>

    <h6>Rules for Forming the Present Tense with Singular Subjects:</h6>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Most verbs:</strong> add <strong>-s</strong> <br> get - gets <br> play - plays <br> eat - eats</li>
        <li><strong>Verbs ending in s, ch, sh, x, and z:</strong> add <strong>-es</strong> <br> pass - passes <br> mix - mixes <br> punch - punches <br> buzz - buzzes <br> push - pushes</li>
        <li><strong>Verbs ending with a consonant and y:</strong> change the y to i and add <strong>-es</strong> <br> try - tries <br> empty - empties</li>
    </ol>
    <div><br></div>
    <ol>
    </ol>
    <h6>The Past Tense</h6>
    <div><br></div>
    <p>A verb which is in past tense shows what has already happened.</p>

    <h6>Example:</h6>
    <p><strong>Tito liked his grandmother's story.</strong></p>
    <p><strong><br></strong></p>
    <p>The verb <strong>liked</strong> tells that the action in the sentence happened before now.</p>
    <p><br></p>

    <h6>Rules for Forming the Past Tense:</h6>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Most verbs:</strong> Add <strong>-ed</strong> <br> play - played <br> talk - talked <br> climb - climbed</li>
        <li><strong>Verbs ending with e:</strong> Add <strong>-d</strong> <br> praise - praised <br> hope - hoped <br> wipe - wiped</li>
        <li><strong>Verbs ending with a consonant and -y:</strong> Change the y to i and add <strong>-ed</strong> <br> bury - buried <br> carry - carried <br> study - studied</li>
        <li><strong>Verbs ending with a single vowel and a consonant:</strong> Double the final consonant and add <strong>-ed</strong> <br> stop - stopped <br> man - manned <br> trip - tripped</li>
    </ol>
    <div><br></div>
    <ol>
    </ol>

    <h6>The Future Tense</h6>
    <div><br></div>
    <p>A verb which is in future tense tells what is going to happen.</p>

    <h6>Examples:</h6>
    <p><strong>Evans will take his car to the garage.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>She will probably come with us.</strong></p>
    <p>The verbs <strong>will take</strong> and <strong>will come</strong> tell us what is going to happen. Hence, they are in future tense.</p>

    <p>To form the future tense of a verb, use the helping verb <strong>will</strong> or <strong>shall</strong> with the main verb.</p>
    <p><br></p>
