        <h6>Active Voice</h6>
        <div><br></div>
        <p>A verb is in <strong id="tolight">active voice</strong> when the subject of the sentence performs the action.</p>
        <p><strong id="togreen">Examples:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Our teacher punished us for making noise in class.<br>
                <span class="example-detail">Subject: Our teacher - Action: punished</span>

                <span class="example-detail">Subject: Players - Action: arrived</span>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <div><br></div>
        <ul>
        </ul>
        <p>In the above sentences, the subject is who performed the action. Hence, the verbs of these sentences are in active voice.</p>
        <p><br></p>
    </div>

    <div class="passive-voice">
        <h6>Passive Voice</h6>
        <p>The word <strong id="tolight">passive</strong> means "acted upon". When the subject of the sentence receives the action or expresses the result of the action, the verb is in passive voice.</p>
        <p><strong id="togreen">Examples:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>We were punished by the teacher for making noise.<br>
                <span class="example-detail">Subject: We - Action: were punished</span>
            </li>
            <li>He was helped by a passer-by.<br>
                <span class="example-detail">Subject: He - Action: was helped</span>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>In the above sentences, the subjects <strong>we</strong> and <strong>he</strong> receive the action.</p>
        <p>When we do not know who or what did the action, or when we do not want to say who or what did it, we use the passive voice.</p>
        <p>The passive form of a verb consists of some form of <strong id="tolight">be</strong> plus the past participle.</p>
