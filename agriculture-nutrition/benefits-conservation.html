    <h5>Benefits Of Soil Conservation</h5>
    <p>Humankind in general and farmers in particular benefit from numerous advantages of soil conservation. This agricultural practice contributes to sustainability in a number of ways:</p>
         <li><strong id="togreen">Boosts earth quality and productivity</strong> Maintaining the natural environment for earth-dwelling organism's <strong id="tolight">increases fertility</strong> and <strong id="tolight">reduces the necessity of chemical fertilizing</strong>, thus boosting yields and saving costs at the same time.

    <li>    <strong id="togreen">Mitigates erosion</strong> Soil conservation methods to reduce erosion and depletion help agriculturalists to avoid the expansion of new lands when territories become infertile.</li>
        
        <li><strong id="togreen"> Promotes water infiltration and increases its storage</strong>. The soil conservation technique of minimum tillage vs. conventional plowing affects soil moisture by <strong id="tolight">>reducing cracking and evaporation </strong>as well as <strong id="tolight">rising the infiltration rate.</strong></li>
         <li> <strong id="togreen">Aids air and water purification</strong>. The importance of soil conservation relates to water supplies, and the earth functions as a natural filter to purify water. Soil conservation mitigates the <strong id="tolight">concentration of pollutants and sediments</strong>. In its turn, water is the basic condition to dissolve nutrients for plants. <strong id="tolight">Soil carbon sequestration</strong> and <strong id="tolight">reduced chemical applications</strong> contribute to air purity, too.</li>
        
        <li><strong id="togreen">Gives food and shelter for wildlife.</strong> Land with growing vegetation is a living environment for animals; it is not only the source for nourishment but their home as well.</li>
