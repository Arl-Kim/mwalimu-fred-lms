    <h6>Subject - Verb Agreement</h6>
    <p>A verb and its subject must agree in number. To agree means that if the subject is singular, the verb must be in singular form. If the subject is plural, the verb form must be plural.</p>
    
    <h6>Examples:</h6>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>The baby cries every morning.</strong> - <em>SINGULAR</em></li>
        <li><strong>The babies cry every morning.</strong> - <em>PLURAL</em></li>
    </ul>
    
    <h6>Rules for Subject-Verb Agreement:</h6>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Singular subject:</strong> Add <strong>-s</strong> or <strong>-es</strong> to the verb <br>
            The man drives a bus. <br>
            She teaches in a primary school. <br>
            He studies his map.</li>
        <li><strong>Plural subject:</strong> Do not add <strong>-s</strong> or <strong>-es</strong> to the verb <br>
            The men drive buses. <br>
            They teach in primary schools. <br>
            We study our maps.</li>
        <li><strong>For I or You:</strong> Do not add <strong>-s</strong> or <strong>-es</strong> to the verb <br>
            I hate books. <br>
            You like dogs. <br>
            I admire actors.</li>
        <li>When a sentence has a compound subject, that is, two subjects joined by <strong>and</strong>, the plural form of the verb is used. <br>
            Examples: <br>
            John and James work at Naivas Supermarket. <br>
            The teachers and the students respect one another a lot.</li>
