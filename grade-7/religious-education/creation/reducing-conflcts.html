    <h6> Reducing conflicts between human beings and wild animals</h6>
        <ul>
            <li>The Kenya constitution protects animals from violence, overworking them when they are unwell, starvation, denial of water, abandonment, poisoning, careless surgery procedures, hunting and killing them.</li>
            <li>We should learn to co-exist with wild animals to reduce conflicts with them.</li>
        </ul>
