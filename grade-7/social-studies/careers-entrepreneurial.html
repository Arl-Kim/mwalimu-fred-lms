    <h6>Gender Stereotypes Associated with Career Choices and Entrepreneurial Opportunities in Social Studies</h6>

        <li>Treating both males and females equally by using texts and curricula that do not promote gender bias.</li>
        <li>Developing policies, laws, and decision-making processes that represent both males and females.</li>
    </ol>
