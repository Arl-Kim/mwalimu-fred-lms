    <h5>Pronouns</h5>
    <p>A <strong id="tolight">pronoun</strong> is a part of speech that takes the place of a noun. They include such words as <strong id="tolight">I, we, he, she, they, me</strong>, and <strong id="tolight">us</strong>.</p>
    <p>Pronouns enable you to avoid repeating the same names (nouns), when writing or speaking, which would otherwise make you sound very awkward and wordy. By using pronouns effectively, you can make your writing and speaking flow smoothly.</p>
    <p>Pronouns can be classified into 6 types. These are <strong id="tolight">personal, indefinite, demonstrative, interrogative, reflexive</strong> and <strong id="tolight">intensive pronouns</strong>.</p>

    <h5>Personal Pronouns</h5>
    <p>A <strong id="tolight">personal pronoun</strong> is a word that is used in place of a noun or another pronoun. They are used to refer to nouns that name persons or things.</p>
    <p><strong id="togreen">Example:</strong></p>
    <div>
        <p><strong id="togreen">Awkward:</strong> Kamau put on Kamau's gum boots. Then Kamau went to the shamba.</p>
        <p><strong id="togreen">Improved:</strong> Kamau put on his gum boots. Then he went to the shamba.</p>
    </div>
    <p>In the above example, the personal pronoun <strong id="tolight">his</strong> helps the writer avoid repeating the same noun. The pronoun <strong id="tolight">he</strong> acts as a bridge to connect the two sentences.</p>
    <p>Personal pronouns are further classified in terms of person and gender.</p>

    <h6 id="togreen">Person</h6>
    <p>In terms of person, personal pronouns can be divided into three classes.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>First person</strong> - I, my, me, we, our, us</li>
        <p>These ones refer to the person(s) speaking.</p>
        <p><strong id="togreen">Example:</strong> I always ride my bike to school.</p>
        <li><strong>Second person</strong> - you, your, yours</li>
        <p>These refer to the person(s) spoken to.</p>
        <p><strong id="togreen">Example:</strong> I will call you tomorrow.</p>
        <li><strong>Third person</strong> - he, his, him, she, hers, her, it, its, they, their, them</li>
        <p>These ones refer to another person(s) or thing(s) that is being spoken of. The personal pronoun <strong id="tolight">it</strong> usually replaces a noun that stands for a thing or an animal. It is never used in place of a person.</p>
    </ul>
