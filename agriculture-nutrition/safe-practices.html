    <h5>Safe Farming Practices That Prevent Soil Pollution</h5>
    <p>Different types of soil conservation methods ensure long-term usage of land and keep it productive for future generations. Let's consider their benefits in regard to soil conservation.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong id="togreen">Conservation Tillage</strong> The conservation tillage aims at addressing wind and water erosion by <strong id="tolight">covering the earth with vegetation</strong> (either crops or their residues) and limiting the number of tilling operations.
            Another significant aspect is to <strong id="tolight">choose the proper time for field operations</strong>, depending on the soil types. For example, clay ones are better to till after harvesting while other types are better to plow before seeding.
        </li>
        <li><strong id="togreen">Contour Farming</strong> - The soil conservation method proves<strong id="tolight"> efficient in slope territories</strong> and suggests planting species<strong id="tolight"> along the contour</strong>. Rows up and down the slope provoke soil erosion due to water currents while rows along the contour restrain it.&nbsp;</li>
        <li><span style="font-size: 0.9375rem;">An impact of terracing is similar: it also helps to conserve soil and </span><strong id="tolight" style="font-size: 0.9375rem;">reduce</strong><span style="font-size: 0.9375rem;"> its&nbsp;degradation processes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>

        </li>


        <li><strong id="togreen">Strip Cropping</strong> In this case, farmers combine high-growing crops with low-growing ones for the sake of<strong id="tolight"> wind protection</strong>, like when corn grows in strips with forage crops. The strip cropping practice works even better when&nbsp;<strong id="tolight">high-growing crops are intensified</strong> in the sides where winds blow most frequently. An extra benefit is the<strong id="tolight"> organic matter material </strong>from the low crops.</li>

    </ul>
    

        <li><strong id="togreen">Windbreaks</strong> As the name suggests, this soil conservation practice is used to <strong id="tolight">reduce the power of winds </strong>and <strong id="tolight">its disruptive effect on soil</strong>. These are trees or bushes to shelter crops from snow and winds planted in several rows. Depending on the number of rows, we can distinguish windbreaks properly (up to five rows) and shelterbelts (six and more).</li>

        <li><strong id="togreen">Crop Rotation</strong> Crop rotation vs. mono-cropping farming suggests<strong id="tolight"> changing agro species</strong> instead of planting one and the same for many subsequent seasons.
            Farmers applying this soil conservation method reap numerous benefits. Crop rotation helps them <strong id="togreen">improve the earth structure </strong>with<strong id="tolight"> diverse root systems</strong>, to <strong id="tolight">mitigate pest establishments</strong>, and to <strong id="tolight">add nitrogen to the land </strong>with legumes known as nitrogen-fixing plants.</li>

        <li><strong id="togreen">Cover Crops</strong>This soil conservation technique is another way to <strong id="tolight">avoid bare soils</strong> and additionally benefit from planting cover crops, secondary species, <strong id="tolight">in-between
                growing cash crops</strong> for different reasons like to:
            produce forage and grazing material for cattle;
            provide green manure;
            assist in weed control;
            retain moisture;
            ensure a natural environment for microorganisms and minor animals;
            balance nitrogen concentration (either releasing or accumulating it with certain plants).
        </li>
        <li><strong id="togreen">Buffer Strips </strong> These are trees and bushes on the banks of water bodies to <strong id="tolight">prevent sediment, water wash offs</strong>. Their roots fix the soil to <strong id="tolight">avoid slumping and erosion</strong>, canopies protect from <strong id="tolight">excessive sunlight</strong> to water inhabitants and falling leaves are a <strong id="tolight">source of organic matter and food </strong>of minor aquatic animals.</li>

        <li><strong id="togreen">Integrated Pest Management</strong> Pests are a great nuisance to agriculturalists and have been a major issue to tackle while chemicals poison nature leaking to water and the atmosphere. It is important to <strong id="tolight">eliminate synthetic herbicides </strong>replacing them with organic ones or establishing biological enemies of pests whenever possible, rotating crop species to minimize increasing pest populations in the same field for years, and using alternative techniques in complex.
