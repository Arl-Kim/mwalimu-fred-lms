    <h5>Physical and Chemical Changes</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>Matter is anything that occupies space and has mass.</li>
        <li>All solids, liquids, and gases are made up of matter.</li>
        <li>The three states of matter have different physical properties.</li>
        <li>These properties depend on intermolecular forces.</li>
        <li>Intermolecular forces are forces that hold the particles of matter together.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h6>Properties of different states of matter.</h6>
    <h6>a. Solids, liquids, and gases are different in terms of their shapes.</h6>
    <p><strong id="togreen">Solids</strong></p>
    <p>Solids have a definite shape which does not change on its own unless use of external forces such as breaking it into smaller pieces.</p>
    <p>For example, when a stone is placed on a table, or a plate or a tin, it does not change its shape according to the item it is placed in or on.</p>
    <br>
    <p><strong id="togreen">Liquids</strong></p>
    <p>A liquid has no definite shape. That means a liquid changes its shape to take the shape of the container or vessel in which it is put. A liquid also changes its shape when spilled on the floor.</p>
    <p>For example, when a liquid is poured into two different containers, the liquid will display two different shapes that resemble or are similar to the container they are placed in. This means liquids lack a definite shape.</p>

    <br>
    <p><strong id="togreen">Gases</strong></p>
    <p>A gas has no definite shape. A gas changes its shape to look like that of the container in which it is held.</p>
    <p>For example, when a balloon is inflated with air, the air inside takes the shape of the balloon.</p>

    <br>
    <h6>b. Solids, liquids, and gases are different in terms of their volumes.</h6>
    
    <p><strong id="togreen">Solids</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>When a solid is totally immersed in a liquid, the volume of the displaced liquid is equivalent (equal) to the volume of the solid.</li>
        <li>The volume of the stone remains the same when placed in two different measuring cylinders. Therefore, solids have a definite shape.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <p><strong id="togreen">Liquids</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>The volume of water poured into a measuring cylinder remains unchanged even when it is transferred from one measuring cylinder to other measuring cylinders of different capacities.</li>
        <li>For example, if you pour 30ml of water into a 50ml measuring cylinder, its reading will be 30ml.</li>
        <li>If the same water is transferred to a 100ml measuring cylinder, the reading will still remain 30ml.</li>
        <li>Therefore, liquids have a definite shape just like solids.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <p><strong id="togreen">Gases</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>A given mass of gas can occupy different volumes in different containers. This is an indication that gases do not have a fixed volume.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h6>c. Solids, liquids, and gases are different in terms of their Compressibility.</h6>
    <p><strong id="togreen">Compressibility</strong> is the ability of a substance to be reduced in volume or size by applying force or pressure on it. Compressibility can also be defined as how much a given volume of matter decreases when pressed.</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>When a bottle is filled with air, it can easily be squeezed compared to one filled up with water.</li>
        <li>If the two are replaced with sand, we cannot squeeze the bottle anymore.</li>
        <li>This experiment proves that gases are highly compressible, liquids have little compressibility while solids are incompressible.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <p><strong id="togreen">Gases</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Occupies entire volume of the container.</li>
        <li>Their particles move freely because the intermolecular forces are very weak.</li>
        <li>This makes particles move far apart from each other and can be brought closer when pressure is applied. This is the reason gases are highly compressible.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <p><strong id="togreen">Liquids</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Their properties lie between those of gases and solids.</li>
        <li>Their intermolecular forces in liquids are weaker than in solids but stronger than in gases.</li>
        <li>The particles in liquids do not move freely as in gases, therefore, it is difficult to compress liquids since the liquid particles can move but keep the same volume.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <p><strong id="togreen">Solids</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Particles in solids are very close to each other (closely packed) and the intermolecular forces between the particles are very strong. The strong forces keep the particles in a fixed position.</li>
        <li>This is the reason why solids are hard, firm, and rigid.</li>
        <li>Therefore, solids are incompressible.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h6>d. Solids, liquids, and gases are different in terms of their ability to flow.</h6>
    <ul>
        <li>Particles in liquids can move from one place to another, therefore, a liquid can flow and change shape. This makes liquids such as water flow from a tap to fill a jar or a bucket. This is applied when pouring tea into a cup.</li>
        <li>Solids have particles that do not move, therefore, solids cannot flow.</li>
        <li>Gases have freely moving particles that can be moved from an area. For example, when you breathe, you force air (gas) into and out of your lungs. This indicates that gas flows in and out of the body. This is also applied when cooking gas flows from the gas cylinders to the burners when cooking.</li>
        <li>Therefore, liquids and gases can flow while solids cannot flow.</li>
    </ul>
