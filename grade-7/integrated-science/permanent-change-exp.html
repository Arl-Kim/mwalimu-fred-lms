    <h6>Permanent Physical Changes</h6>

    <h6>Experiment to Demonstrate Permanent Chemical Change</h6>

    <h6>Requirements:</h6>
    <ul>
        <li>5cm magnesium ribbon.</li>
        <li>A source of heat.</li>
        <li>Sand paper.</li>
        <li>A pair of tongs.</li>
        <li>Writing materials</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h6>Procedure:</h6>
    <ul>
        <li>Clean the magnesium ribbon by rubbing it with sand paper. Examine the appearance of the magnesium ribbon.</li>
        <li>Hold the ribbon with a pair of tongs over a burning candle or Bunsen burner for a few minutes.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h6 style="color: red">Caution:</h6>
    <p>Burning magnesium ribbon produces a very bright flame that can damage your eyes. Avoid looking directly at the flame. </p>
    
    <h6>Observations, Explanation & Conclusion:</h6>
    <ul>
        <li>Magnesium ribbon burns with a bright light forming a white ash. 
            If the magnesium ribbon is not shining it may take long to ignite. 
            Therefore, is advisable to clean the ribbon by rubbing it with sand paper 
            since it is coated with an oxide layer that prevents it from burning.</li>
        <li>Burning magnesium ribbon form a substance called magnesium oxide. 
            A change in which one or more substances are formed is known as chemical change. </li>
        <li>A chemical change is also known as permanent change. Most chemical changes are irreversible in nature. </li>
        <li>Chemical changes are important in life. Example of chemical changes include:
            <ul>
                <li>Digestion of food in the body.</li>
                <li>Ripening of fruits.</li>
                <li>Fermentation of grapes.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
