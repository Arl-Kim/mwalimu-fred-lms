    <h5>The origin of the solar system</h5>
        <h6>The passing star theory</h6>
            <ul>
                <li>A star with a greater gravitational pull passed near the sun</li>
                <li>It attracted large quantities of gaseous materials from the sun</li>
                <li>The materials split, cooled and condensed to form planets</li>
                <li>The planets were set in orbit by the passing star</li>
            </ul>
        <h6>The nebula cloud theory</h6>
            <ul>
                <li>There was a slowly rotating cloud of dust and gas called Nebula</li>
                <li>It cooled and began to contact</li>
                <li>Rotation speed increased and successive rings of gaseous materials were formed.</li>
                <li>The rings condensed to form planets</li>
                <li>The central gaseous material remained as the sun</li>

            </ul>
