    <h5>Pure and Impure substances</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>When two pure substances are mixed together, they form a mixture.</li>
        <li>A mixture is an impure substance. Therefore, a pure substance is any material that is not a mixture at all.</li>
        <li>The melting and boiling points of pure and impure substances can be determined.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h6>Melting point of pure substances (Ice)</h6>
    <ul>
        <li>It is the temperature at which a solid changes into a liquid state.</li>
        <li>The melting point of ice is the temperature at which ice is converted from its solid state to its liquid state.</li>
        <li>Heat from a heat source is used to melt the ice.</li>
        <li>The thermometer helps to note the temperature at which the ice melts.</li>
        <li>After the initial and final readings are taken, it will be observed that once the ice attains its melting temperature (0°C), the temperature remains the same until all the ice is converted into a liquid state.</li>
        <li>Pure solids have specific melting points. Therefore, it means that ice is a pure substance.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h6>Melting point of Impure substances (Candle wax)</h6>
    <ul>
        <li>The melting point of candle wax is the temperature at which the solid material turns into liquid (by heating it).</li>
        <li>The melting point of candle wax ranges between 46°C to 68°C. Therefore, it means that candle wax is an impure substance.</li>
        <li>Impure substances do not have specific melting points. The presence of impurities affects the melting point of the substances.</li>
