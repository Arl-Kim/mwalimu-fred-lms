    <h5>Physical and Chemical Changes</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>Matter is anything that occupies space and has mass.</li>
        <li>All solids, liquids, and gases are made up of matter.</li>
        <li>The three states of matter have different physical properties.</li>
        <li>These properties depend on intermolecular forces.</li>
        <li>Intermolecular forces are forces that hold the particles of matter together.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h6>Properties of different states of matter.</h6>
    <h6>a. Solids, liquids, and gases are different in terms of their shapes.</h6>
    <p><strong id="togreen">Solids</strong></p>
    <p>Solids have a definite shape which does not change on its own unless use of external forces such as breaking it into smaller pieces.</p>
    <p>For example, when a stone is placed on a table, or a plate or a tin, it does not change its shape according to the item it is placed in or on.</p>
    <br>
    <p><strong id="togreen">Liquids</strong></p>
    <p>A liquid has no definite shape. That means a liquid changes its shape to take the shape of the container or vessel in which it is put. A liquid also changes its shape when spilled on the floor.</p>
    <p>For example, when a liquid is poured into two different containers, the liquid will display two different shapes that resemble or are similar to the container they are placed in. This means liquids lack a definite shape.</p>
    <br>
    <p><strong id="togreen">Gases</strong></p>
    <p>A gas has no definite shape. A gas changes its shape to look like that of the container in which it is held.</p>
    <p>For example, when a balloon is inflated with air, the air inside takes the shape of the balloon.</p>
    <br>
    <h6>b. Solids, liquids, and gases are different in terms of their volumes.</h6>
    
    <p><strong id="togreen">Solids</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>When a solid is totally immersed in a liquid, the volume of the displaced liquid is equivalent (equal) to the volume of the solid.</li>
        <li>The volume of the stone remains the same when placed in two different measuring cylinders. Therefore, solids have a definite shape.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <p><strong id="togreen">Liquids</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>The volume of water poured into a measuring cylinder remains unchanged even when it is transferred from one measuring cylinder to other measuring cylinders of different capacities.</li>
        <li>For example, if you pour 30ml of water into a 50ml measuring cylinder, its reading will be 30ml.</li>
        <li>If the same water is transferred to a 100ml measuring cylinder, the reading will still remain 30ml.</li>
        <li>Therefore, liquids have a definite shape just like solids.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <p><strong id="togreen">Gases</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>A given mass of gas can occupy different volumes in different containers. This is an indication that gases do not have a fixed volume.</li>
    </ul>
