    <h6>Introduction</h6>

    <ul>
        <li>A fraction whose denominator can be written as the power of 10 is called a decimal fraction or a decimal. E.g. <strong id="tolight">¹/₁₀</strong>, <strong id="tolight">¹/₁₀₀</strong>, <strong id="tolight">⁵⁰/₁₀₀₀</strong>.</li>
        <li>A decimal is always written as follows: <strong id="tolight">¹/₁₀</strong> is written as <strong id="tolight">0.1</strong>, while <strong id="tolight">⁵/₁₀₀</strong> is written as <strong id="tolight">0.05</strong>. The dot is called the decimal point.</li>
        <li>Numbers after the decimal points are read as single digits. E.g. <strong id="tolight">5.875</strong> is read as five point eight seven five.</li>
        <li>A decimal fraction such as <strong id="tolight">8.3</strong> means 8 + <strong id="tolight">³/₁₀</strong>. A decimal fraction that represents the sum of a whole number and a proper fraction is called a mixed fraction.</li>
