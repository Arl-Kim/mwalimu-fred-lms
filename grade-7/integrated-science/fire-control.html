    <h5>Fire Control Measures</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>To prevent the start and spread of fire, one or more components should be removed from the fire triangle.</li>
        <li>A fire triangle in a simple model of understanding the components of fire which are fuel, heat and oxygen. </li>
        <li>Therefore, to control fire one or more components should be removed from the fire triangle as follows:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Removing Fuel:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Use fire-resistant materials where possible.</li>
                    <li>This will help to prevent the fire from starting and spreading.</li>
                </ul></li><br>
                <li><strong>Removing Heat:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Water is mostly used to remove the heat from fire.</li>
                        <li>A water fire extinguisher would be the safest way of doing this.</li>
                        <li>However, these extinguishers cannot be used on all types of fire.</li>
                    </ul></li><br>
                <li><strong>Removing Oxygen:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>It is important to remove oxygen gas from the fire triangle to prevent spread of a fire.</li>
                        <li>This can be achieved by using either a <strong id="tolight">carbon (IV) oxide</strong>or a form fire extinguisher.</li>
                    </ul></li><br>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Fire extinguishers</strong> come in different types depending on the kind of environment you are in. 
        Some places such as school, work or home, one or more types of fire extinguishers may be required. 
        The following are different types of fire extinguishers and the classes of fire they put
