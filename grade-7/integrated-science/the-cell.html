    <h6>The Cell</h6>
    <ul>
        <li>Cells make up the structure of living organisms and carry out various biological processes.</li>
        <li>Organisms such as amoeba are composed of a single cell hence are said to be unicellular.</li>
        <li>Organisms such as plants and animals are composed of many cells hence are said to be multicellular.</li>
        <li>Therefore, a cell is defined as the basic unit of structure and functions in organisms.</li>
        <li>To observe the cell, a powerful magnifying instrument called a microscope is used.</li>
        <li>A microscope enlarges the image of objects when observed and improves the resolution of the image.</li>
