        <li><strong>Solutes and Solvent</strong>
            <p>When a solid is dissolved in a liquid, we get a solution formed. 
            The solid that dissolves in this solution is called the <strong id=tolight>solute.</strong> 
            The liquid that dissolves the solid is known as the <strong id=tolight>solvent.</strong></p> 
            <h6>For example,</h6>
            <p>Sugar and salt are examples of substances (solutes) that are soluble in water (solvent)</p>

        <li><strong>Concentration</strong>
            <p>When there are more solute molecules compared to solvent molecules, a solution is said to be <strong id=tolight>concentrated.</strong> 
            When there are more solvent molecules compared to solute molecules, then the solution is said to be <strong id=tolight>dilute</strong>
