    <br><br>
    <h6>Requirements for the Experiment</h6>
    <ul>
        <li>Boiling tube</li>
        <li>Thermometer</li>
        <li>Heating apparatus</li>
        <li>Distilled water</li>
        <li>A spatula</li>
        <li>Salt and water</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h6>Procedure for the Experiment Above</h6>
    <ul>
        <li>Put about 10cm<sup>3</sup> of distilled water in a boiling tube.</li>
        <li>Close the tube with a stopper that has two holes.</li>
        <li>Pass a thermometer through one hole and immerse the thermometer bulb into the water.</li>
        <li>Push an ‘L’ shaped tube through the other hole.</li>
        <li>Heat the apparatus using a small flame.</li>
        <li>Observe the changes in temperature and record your observations.</li>
        <li>Cool the apparatus and remove the stopper.</li>
        <li>Add a spoonful of salt to some water and stir to dissolve all the salt to form a salty water solution.</li>
        <li>Repeat the experiment using the salty water solution in place of pure distilled water.</li>
        <li>Observe changes in temperature and record your observations. What conclusion have you made?</li>
        <li>At what temperature does pure water boil?</li>
        <li>At what temperature does water with dissolved salt (impure water) boil?</li>
        <li>Compare your observations.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h6>Observations, Conclusion & Explanation</h6>
    <ul>
        <li>When distilled water is heated, the temperature of the water rises to about 100°C.</li>
        <li>After this, the temperature remains constant for some time. The heat absorbed changes liquid water into water vapor or steam.</li>
        <li>Pure water has a definite or specific boiling point.</li>
        <li>Salty (impure) water has a range of boiling temperatures above 100°C.</li>
        <li>Impurities cause a rise in the boiling point of liquids.</li>
        <li>The greater the impurities in a given solution, the higher the boiling point. Therefore, we can use the boiling point to determine the purity of a liquid.</li>
    </ul>
