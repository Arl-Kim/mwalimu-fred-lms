    <h5>Functions of Computer Hardware</h5>
    <p>
        <strong id="tolight">Input devices</strong> are used to enter data and instructions into the computer. They include:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>mouse,</li>
        <li>keyboard,</li>
        <li>touch-pad,</li>
        <li>joystick,</li>
        <li>scanner,</li>
        <li>camera,</li>
        <li>microphone,</li>
        <li>stylus.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong id="tolight">CPU</strong> - it processes the data entered into the computer according to the instructions given by the computer user. 
            It is the brain of the computer and is also called the processor. It is made up of:
            <ul>
                <li>Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU),</li>
                <li>Control Unit,</li>
                <li>Registers.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>It retrieves and executes instructions by coordinating and processing all the functions of a computer.</p>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            <strong id="tolight">Output devices</strong> - they are used to give out information from the computer. Examples of output devices include:
            <ul>
                <li>monitor,</li>
                <li>speakers,</li>
                <li>plotter,</li>
                <li>headphones,</li>
                <li>projectors,</li>
                <li>printer.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            <strong id="tolight">Storage devices</strong> - they are used to store data and information. They save data, information, computer software, and running operations. Examples of storage devices include:
            <ul>
                <li>hard disk,</li>
                <li>memory card,</li>
                <li>flash disk,</li>
                <li>external hard disks.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h5>Selecting Appropriate Hardware for Different Situations</h5>
    <p>Different computer hardware components are used in different situations depending on the tasks to be performed. Examples:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>For a taxi driver to communicate with his client, he has to use a phone.</li>
        <li>To accurately capture item prices in a supermarket, a scanner is used.</li>
        <li>During presentations, a speaker and projector are required alongside a computer.</li>
    </ul>
