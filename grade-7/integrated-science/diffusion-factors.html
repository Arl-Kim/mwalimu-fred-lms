    <h5>Factors that affect the Rate of Diffusion</h5>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Concentration Gradient -</strong> molecules move from a region of high concentration to that of low concentration. 
        The greater the difference in concentration between high and low regions, the faster the rate of diffusion.</li>
        <li><strong>Temperature -</strong> high temperature increases energy and therefore faster movement of molecules. 
        This increases the rate of diffusion.</li>
        <li><strong>Mass of Particles -</strong> heavy particles move slowly hence slower rate of diffusion.
        Light particles on the other hand move fast hence faster rate of diffusion.</li>
        <li><strong>Diffusion Distance -</strong> rate of diffusion depends on distance that particles have to travel in order to be 
        evenly distributed within available space.</li>
        <li><strong>Medium of Diffusion -</strong> particles diffuse faster through gases than liquids.</li>
        <li><strong>Surface Area to Volume Ratio -</strong> diffusion occurs faster in smaller organisms as compared to larger organisms. 
        This is because small organisms have a large surface area to volume ratio.</li>
    </ul>
