    <h2>Education In Kenya - <span id="tolight">A Brief History</span></h2>
    <p>
        Education in Kenya has undergone significant transformation since the colonial era. Initially, formal education was introduced by missionaries in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, focusing on basic literacy and religious instruction. Following Kenya's independence in 1963, the government prioritized education as a key driver for national development. This led to the introduction of the 7-4-2-3 system, which was later replaced in 1985 by the 8-4-4 system (8 years of primary education, 4 years of secondary education, and 4 years of university education) to emphasize practical skills and self-reliance <br><br>The introduction of free primary education in 2003 and free secondary education in 2008 marked major milestones, significantly increasing enrollment rates. In recent years, Kenya has introduced the Competency-Based Curriculum (CBC), aimed at developing learners' skills and competencies from an early age to better prepare them for the challenges of the 21st century.
