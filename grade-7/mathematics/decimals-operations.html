    <h5>Operation on Decimals</h5>

    <h6>Addition and Subtraction</h6>
    <p>The key point with addition and subtraction is to line up the decimal points!</p>

    <h6>Example</h6>
    <p><strong id="tolight">2.64 + 11.2</strong></p>

    <p><strong id="toblue">Solution</strong></p>
    <p>2.64<br>+ 11.20 &rarr; in this case, it helps to write <strong id="toblue">11.2</strong> as <strong id="toblue">11.20</strong></p>
    <p><strong id="toblue">13.84</strong></p>

    <h6>Example</h6>
    <p><strong id="tolight">14.73 − 12.155</strong></p>

    <p><strong id="toblue">Solution</strong></p>
    <p>14.730 &rarr; again adding this 0 helps<br>−12.155</p>
    <p><strong id="toblue">2.575</strong></p>

    <h6>Example</h6>
    <p><strong id="tolight">127.5 + 0.127</strong></p>

    <p><strong id="toblue">Solution</strong></p>
    <p>127.50<br>+ 0.127</p>
    <p><strong id="toblue">127.627</strong></p>

    <h6>Multiplication</h6>
    <p>When multiplying decimals, do the sum as if the decimal points were not there, and then calculate how many numbers were to the right of the decimal point in both the original numbers. Next, place the decimal point in your answer so that there is this number of digits to the right of your decimal point.</p>

    <h6>Example</h6>
    <p><strong id="tolight">2.1 × 1.2</strong></p>
    <p>Calculate <strong id="tolight">21 × 12 = 252</strong>. There is one number to the right of the decimal in each of the original numbers, making a total of two.</p>
    <p>We therefore place our decimal so that there are two digits to the right of the decimal point in our answer. Hence <strong id="toblue">2.1 × 1.2 = 2.52</strong>.</p>
    <p>Always look at your answer to see if it is sensible. <strong id="toblue">2 × 1 = 2</strong>, so our answer should be close to 2 rather than 20 or 0.2 which could be the answers obtained by putting the decimal in the wrong place.</p>

    <h6>Example</h6>
    <p><strong id="tolight">1.4 × 6</strong></p>
    <p>Calculate <strong id="tolight">14 × 6 = 84</strong>.</p>
    <p>There is one digit to the right of the decimal in our original numbers, so our answer is <strong id="toblue">8.4</strong>. Check <strong id="toblue">1 × 6 = 6</strong> so our answer should be closer to 6 than 60 or 0.6.</p>

    <h6>Division</h6>
    <p>When dividing decimals, the first step is to write your numbers as a fraction. Note that the symbol <strong id="toblue">/</strong> is used to denote division in these notes.</p>
    <p>Hence <strong id="toblue">2.14 / 1.2</strong> = <strong id="toblue">2.14</strong> / <strong id="toblue">1.2</strong></p>
    <p>Next, move the decimal point to the right until both numbers are no longer decimals. Do this the same number of places on the top and bottom, putting in zeros as required.</p>
    <p>Hence <strong id="toblue">2.14 / 1.2</strong> becomes <strong id="toblue">214 / 120</strong></p>
    <p>This can then be calculated as a normal division. Always check your answer from the original to make sure that things haven’t gone wrong along the way. You would expect <strong id="toblue">2.14/1.2</strong> to be somewhere between 1 and 2. In fact, the answer is <strong id="toblue">1.78</strong>.</p>
    <p>If this method seems strange, try using a calculator to calculate <strong id="toblue">2.14/1.2</strong>, <strong id="toblue">21.4/12</strong>, <strong id="toblue">214/120</strong>, and <strong id="toblue">2140/1200</strong>. The answer should always be the same.</p>

    <h6>Example</h6>
    <p><strong id="tolight">4.36 / 0.14</strong></p>

    <p><strong id="toblue">Solution</strong></p>
    <p>4.36 = <strong id="tolight">436 / 14</strong></p>
    <p><strong id="toblue">31.14</strong></p>

    <h6>Example</h6>
    <p><strong id="tolight">27.93 / 1.2</strong></p>

    <p><strong id="toblue">Solution</strong></p>
    <p>27.93 = <strong id="tolight">2793 / 120</strong></p>
    <p><strong id="toblue">23.28</strong></p>
