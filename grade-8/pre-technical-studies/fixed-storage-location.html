    <h5>Location of Fixed Storage Devices in a Computer</h5>
    <p>Some fixed storage devices in a computer, such as the hard disk and solid-state drive, are usually found in the drive bay of the computer case or on the underside of a laptop. Some solid-state drives are embedded on the motherboard. Internal flash drives are mostly located in small portable devices such as mobile phones and cameras.</p>
    <h5>How Data is Stored (Written) and Retrieved (Read) from Fixed Storage Devices</h5>
    <p>Writing data or saving data means storing data. Data is written on a fixed storage device by:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Creating new files.</li>
        <li>Downloading.</li>
        <li>Copying or moving files and saving them in a computer storage device.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <p>Reading data, retrieving data, or opening data is the same as getting data back from its location. When data is opened or a file is accessed in a fixed storage device, then the data is read.</p>
