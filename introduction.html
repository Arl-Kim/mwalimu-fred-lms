    <h2>About Mwalimu Fred Online</h2>
    <p>

    <h2>Education In Kenya - <span id="tolight">A Brief History</span></h2>
    <p>
        Education in Kenya has undergone significant transformation since the colonial era. Initially, formal education was introduced by missionaries in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, focusing on basic literacy and religious instruction. Following Kenya's independence in 1963, the government prioritized education as a key driver for national development. This led to the introduction of the 7-4-2-3 system, which was later replaced in 1985 by the 8-4-4 system (8 years of primary education, 4 years of secondary education, and 4 years of university education) to emphasize practical skills and self-reliance. <br><br>The introduction of free primary education in 2003 and free secondary education in 2008 marked major milestones, significantly increasing enrollment rates. In recent years, Kenya has introduced the Competency-Based Curriculum (CBC), aimed at developing learners' skills and competencies from an early age to better prepare them for the challenges of the 21st century.

    <h2>The CBC Rationale - <span id="tolight">An Overview</span></h2>
    <p>
        The Competency-Based Curriculum (CBC) in Kenya was introduced to address the limitations of the previous 8-4-4 system, which was criticized for being overly focused on exams and rote learning. The CBC aims to develop a holistic education system that emphasizes the acquisition of skills, knowledge, values, and attitudes necessary for learners to thrive in the 21st century. By focusing on competencies such as critical thinking, creativity, communication, and collaboration, the CBC seeks to nurture learners' individual talents and prepare them for the demands of the modern world.<br><br>In Junior School, the number of subjects was reduced from 14 to 9, and the number of lessons reduced from 45 to 40.The curriculum is designed to be learner-centered and flexible, allowing students to progress at their own pace while engaging in practical, hands-on activities that are relevant to real-life situations. This approach is intended to produce well-rounded individuals who are capable of contributing positively to society and the economy.
