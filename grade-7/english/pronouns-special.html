    <h5>Special Pronouns Problems</h5>
    <h6>1. Double Subjects</h6>
    <p>We all know that every sentence must have a subject. Sometimes we <strong id="tolight">incorrectly</strong> use a double subject - a <strong id="tolight">noun</strong> and a <strong id="tolight">pronoun</strong> - to name the same person, place, or thing.</p>
    <div class="examples">
        <p><strong>Incorrect:</strong> <strong id="tolight">Jane she</strong> is my cousin.</p>
        <p><strong>Correct:</strong> Jane is my cousin. / <strong id="tolight">She</strong> is my cousin.</p>
        <p><strong>Incorrect:</strong> <strong id="tolight">Her scarf it</strong> is pretty.</p>
        <p><strong>Correct:</strong> Her scarf is pretty. / <strong id="tolight">It</strong> is pretty.</p>
    </div>
    <p><strong id="tolight">Jane</strong> and <strong id="tolight">she</strong> should not be used as subjects together. The subject her scarf should not be used together with it. Use only a noun or a pronoun to name a subject.</p>
    <h6>2. Pronouns and Their Antecedents</h6>
    <p>The <strong id="tolight">antecedent</strong> of a pronoun is a noun or another pronoun for which the pronoun stands. A personal pronoun is used in place of a noun, and the noun is the word to which the pronoun refers; it is therefore its <strong id="tolight">antecedent</strong>.</p>
    <p>The noun usually comes first, either in the same sentence or in the sentence before it.</p>
    <div class="examples">
        <h6>Examples</h6>
        <p>We met <strong id="tolight">Mureithi</strong>. <strong id="tolight">He</strong> is the medical doctor. (<strong id="tolight">He</strong> stands for <strong id="tolight">Mureithi</strong>. <strong id="tolight">Mureithi</strong> is the antecedent.)</p>
        <p><strong id="tolight">The students</strong> had come to school with <strong id="tolight">their</strong> mobile phones. (<strong id="tolight">Their</strong> stands for <strong id="tolight">students</strong>. <strong id="tolight">Students</strong> is the antecedent.)</p>
    </div>
    <p>Pronouns may be the antecedents of other pronouns.</p>
    <div class="examples">
        <h6>Examples</h6>
        <p>Does <strong id="tolight">everybody</strong> have <strong id="tolight">his</strong> booklet? (<strong id="tolight">Everybody</strong>, which is a singular indefinite pronoun, is the antecedent of <strong id="tolight">his</strong>.)</p>
        <p><strong id="tolight">All</strong> of the students have brought <strong id="tolight">theirs</strong>. (<strong id="tolight">All</strong>, which is a plural indefinite pronoun, is the antecedent of <strong id="tolight">theirs</strong>.)</p>
    </div>
    <p>Now, a pronoun must <strong id="tolight">agree</strong> with its antecedent in number. <strong id="tolight">Agree</strong> here means that the pronoun must be the same <strong id="tolight">in number</strong> as its antecedent. The word <strong id="tolight">number</strong> means <strong id="tolight">singular</strong> or <strong id="tolight">plural</strong>.</p>
    <p>If the pronoun is singular, the word that it stands for must be <strong id="tolight">singular</strong>, and it must be plural if the word it stands for is <strong id="tolight">plural</strong>.</p>
    <div class="examples">
        <h6>Examples:</h6>
        <p><strong>Correct:</strong> The <strong id="tolight">scientists</strong> tested <strong id="tolight">their</strong> new discovery. (<strong id="tolight">Scientists</strong> is plural; <strong id="tolight">their</strong> is plural.)</p>
        <p><strong>Incorrect:</strong> The <strong id="tolight">scientists</strong> tested <strong id="tolight">his</strong> new discovery.</p>
        <p><strong>Correct:</strong> Mr. <strong id="tolight">Kiama</strong> turned on <strong id="tolight">his</strong> TV. (Mr. <strong id="tolight">Kiama</strong> is singular; <strong id="tolight">his</strong> is singular.)</p>
        <p><strong>Correct:</strong> <strong id="tolight">Nobody</strong> left <strong id="tolight">her</strong> workstation. (<strong id="tolight">Nobody</strong> is singular; <strong id="tolight">her</strong> is singular.)</p>
    </div>
    <p><strong id="togreen">NB:</strong> When the antecedent refers to both males and females, it is best to use the phrase <strong id="tolight">his or her</strong>.</p>
    <h6>3. Use of We and Us with Nouns</h6>
    <p>Phrases such as <strong id="toblue">we students</strong> and <strong id="toblue">us girls</strong> are often incorrectly used. To tell which pronoun to use, drop the <strong id="tolight">noun</strong> and say the sentence without it.</p>
    <div class="examples">
        <p><strong>Problem:</strong> (We, Us) boys study hard.</p>
        <p><strong>Solution:</strong> We study hard. = <strong id="tolight">We boys</strong> study hard.</p>
        <p><strong>Problem:</strong> The DC praised. (us, we) students.</p>
        <p><strong>Solution:</strong> The DC praised us. = The DC praised <strong id="tolight">us students</strong>.</p>
    </div>
    <h6>4. Using the Pronoun Them</h6>
    <p>The word <strong id="tolight">them</strong> is always a pronoun. It is always used as the object of a verb or a preposition, never as a subject.</p>
    <div class="examples">
        <h6>Examples:</h6>
        <p><strong>Correct:</strong> The president greeted <strong id="tolight">them</strong>. (Direct object of the verb <strong id="tolight">greeted</strong>)</p>
        <p><strong>Correct:</strong> She gave <strong id="tolight">them</strong> a sandwich. (Indirect object of the verb <strong id="tolight">gave</strong>)</p>
        <p><strong>Correct:</strong> The information was useful to <strong id="tolight">them</strong>. (Object of the preposition <strong id="tolight">to</strong>)</p>
        <p><strong>Incorrect:</strong> <strong id="tolight">Them</strong> they arrived late.</p>
    </div>
    <h6>5. Using Those</h6>
    <p>Although we previously said that <strong id="tolight">those</strong> is used as a <strong id="toblue">demonstrative pronoun</strong>, it is sometimes used as an <strong id="toblue">adjective</strong>, i.e., a word that modifies a noun or a pronoun. If a noun appears immediately after it, <strong id="tolight">those</strong> is now an adjective, not a pronoun.</p>
    <div class="examples">
        <p><strong id="togreen">Examples:</strong></p>
        <p><strong id="tolight">Those</strong> are the new desks that were bought. (Those is a pronoun, the subject of the verb are.)</p>
        <p><strong id="tolight">Those</strong> desks are attractive. (Those is an adjective modifying the noun desks.)</p>
