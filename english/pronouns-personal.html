<div class="object-pronouns">
    <h5>Object Pronouns</h5>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Singular:</strong> me, you, him, her, it</li>
        <li><strong>Plural:</strong> us, you, them</li>

    </div>
    <p>In the above examples, the personal pronouns are the direct or indirect objects of the verbs before them.</p>
    <p><strong id="tolight">Object pronouns</strong> can also replace nouns after prepositions such as <em>to, for, with, in, at</em> or <em>by</em>. That is, they can be objects of prepositions.</p>

    <p>There are two kinds of possessive pronouns:</p>
    
    <h6 id="togreen">i. Those used as adjectives to modify nouns.</h6>
    <p>These possessive pronouns are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Singular:</strong> My, your, his, her, its</li>
        <li><strong>Plural:</strong> Our, your, their</li>

        <p>Pay your bills. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They removed their bats.</p>
    </div>
