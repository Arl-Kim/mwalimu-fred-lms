    <h5>King Saul’s Failures and the Consequences</h5>
    <p>When leaders went to Prophet Samuel and asked for a king, Samuel prayed to God for guidance. God instructed him to go to a man called Saul who was the son of Kish from the tribe of Benjamin. Samuel obeyed God and anointed Saul as the king. He poured oil on Saul’s head and the people shouted “long live the king,” hence Saul became the first king of Israel.</p>
    <p>King Saul had both success and failures. Saul’s failures were as a result of his weaknesses and eventually God rejected him as king of Israel. King Saul’s failures were as follows:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>He offered sacrifices to God at Gilgal instead of waiting for Prophet Samuel.</li>
        <li>He failed to obey the law of total destruction of an enemy conquered.</li>
    </ul><br>
    <h6>Consequences of King Saul’s Failure</h6>
    <p>Prophet Samuel prophesied the end of Saul’s rule. Saul was to be replaced by a man God wanted. God regretted making Saul the king and He rejected him as the king of Israel. (1 Samuel 15:22-33) The spirit of God left King Saul and was replaced by an evil spirit.</p>

    <h6>Lessons Learned from King Saul’s Failure</h6>
    <ul>
        <li>Patience is important—King Saul’s impatience made him lose the opportunity to lead the Israelites. Christians should be patient as they wait for the fulfillment of God’s promises.</li>
        <li>Leaders should fully understand the specific duties and responsibilities that relate to their offices—Saul took the responsibilities of priests and prophets by taking up duties of making sacrifices to God.</li>
        <li>Faith and trust in God is important—when Samuel delayed in coming, Saul feared the Philistines and lost faith in God. Leaders should not allow fear to lead them into disobedience.</li>
        <li>Need for obedience—leaders should obey God’s instructions.</li>
        <li>Disobedience has consequences—leaders should know that disobedience is punishable.</li>
        <li>There is a need to be sincere and honest—leaders should uphold sincerity and honesty.</li>
    </ul><br>
