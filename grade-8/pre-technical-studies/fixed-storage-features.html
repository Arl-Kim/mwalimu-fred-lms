    <h5>Features of Fixed Storage Devices</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>The devices are usually found inside the computer case.</li>
        <li>They are non-volatile and data stored will remain saved even when power supply is interrupted.</li>
        <li>Their storage capacity is high.</li>
        <li>They can be read from and written to.</li>
        <li>They are cheaper compared to primary storage devices.</li>
    </ul>

    <h6>Advantages of Fixed Storage Devices</h6>
    <ul>
        <li>They store data permanently.</li>
        <li>They provide fast access to data.</li>
        <li>They have large storage capacities.</li>
    </ul>

    <h6>A Hard Disk Drive</h6>
    <p>Usually has one or more metallic platters stacked on top of each other. The stack of platters is attached to a rotating pole called spindle. The platters are used to store data. Data is read and written to a hard disk using the principle of magnetism.</p>

    <h6>Solid State Drive</h6>
    <p>Uses integrated circuits to store data permanently. Data in solid state drives is accessed randomly. Solid state drives are used in personal computers such as laptops, cameras, tablets, and smartphones.</p>

    <h6>The Internal Flash Memory</h6>
    <p>A non-volatile memory used to store data in computers, digital cameras, universal serial bus (USB) flash drives, and MP3 players. Data in flash memory can be electrically erased and new data stored in it.</p>
