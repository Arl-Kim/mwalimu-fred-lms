    <h5>Decimal to Fractions</h5>

    <p>✓ To convert a number from fraction form to decimal form, simply divide the numerator (the top number) by the denominator (the bottom number) of the fraction.</p>

    <h6>Example:</h6>
    <p><strong id="tolight">⁵/₈</strong></p>

    <h5>Converting a Decimal to a Fraction</h5>

    <p>✓ To change a decimal to a fraction, determine the place value of the last number in the decimal. This becomes the denominator. The decimal number becomes the numerator. Then reduce your answer.</p>

    <h6>Example:</h6>
    <p><strong id="toblue">.625</strong> - the 5 is in the thousandths column, therefore,</p>
    <p><strong id="toblue">.625</strong> = <strong id="tolight">⁶²⁵/₁₀₀₀</strong> = reduces to <strong id="tolight">⁵/₈</strong></p>

    <p><strong id="toblue">Note:</strong><br> Your denominator will have the same number of zeros as there are decimal digits in the decimal number you started with - <strong id="toblue">.625</strong> has three decimal digits, so the denominator will have three zeros.</p>
