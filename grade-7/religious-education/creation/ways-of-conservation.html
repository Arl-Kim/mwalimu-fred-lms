    <h5>Ways in which Africans promoted care and conservation of all types of plants</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>The Africans protected plants by weeding, pruning, mulching, shading, trapping and scaring away animals that fed on the plants.</li>
	        <li>They also preserved seeds of the plants to last longer during dry periods and to protect them from small such as rats and weevils.</li>
            <li>This conservation ensured that Africans had seeds to plants during the rainy seasons.</li>
            <li>Preserved seeds and plants served as source of food during drought.</li>
	        <li>Africans used fire to make plants sprout out more serving as food for the animals.</li>
        </ul>
