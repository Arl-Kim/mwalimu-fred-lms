    <h5>Relating Common Elements to Their Symbols</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>Pure substances, either elements or compounds, have a unique name and symbol.</li>
        <li>A symbol is a shorthand notation for the chemical name of an element.</li>
        <li>Chemical symbols are used instead of names by scientists because they are much easier, convenient, and universally recognized.</li>
        <li>Compounds are represented by a chemical formula.</li>
        <li>A chemical symbol is usually derived from the first letter of the English name of the element.</li>
        <li>It is also derived from the Latin name of the element.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong id="togreen">For example</strong>,</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong id="tolight">H</strong> is the chemical symbol of <strong id="tolight">hydrogen</strong>.</li>
        <li><strong id="tolight">O</strong> is the chemical symbol of <strong id="tolight">oxygen</strong>.</li>
        <li><strong id="tolight">K</strong> is the chemical symbol of <strong id="tolight">potassium</strong>. For potassium, the <strong id="tolight">K</strong> is derived from the Latin word Kalium.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <p>Some elements might start with the same first letters, such as <strong id="tolight">carbon</strong>, <strong id="tolight">calcium</strong>, <strong id="tolight">chlorine</strong>, and <strong id="tolight">copper</strong>, which all have their names starting with the letter <strong id="tolight">C</strong>. Therefore, the letter <strong id="tolight">C</strong> cannot be used to represent all of them as a chemical symbol.</p>
    <p>The first letter <strong id="tolight">C</strong> is assigned to represent <strong id="tolight">carbon</strong>, while the rest of the elements are assigned two letters from their names as follows:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong id="tolight">Carbon</strong> is represented by <strong id="tolight">C</strong>.</li>
        <li><strong id="tolight">Calcium</strong> is represented by <strong id="tolight">Ca</strong>.</li>
        <li><strong id="tolight">Chlorine</strong> is represented by <strong id="tolight">Cl</strong>.</li>
        <li><strong id="tolight">Copper</strong> is represented by <strong id="tolight">Cu</strong> from the Latin word cuprum.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <p>The first letter of a symbol is always capitalized, while the second letter is written in small letters.</p>
