    <h5>Permanent Chemical Changes</h5>

    <h6>Experiment to Demonstrate Permanent Chemical Change</h6>

    <h6>Requirements:</h6>
    <ul>
        <li>5cm <strong id="tolight">magnesium ribbon.</strong></li>
        <li>A source of heat.</li>
        <li>Sand paper.</li>
        <li>A pair of tongs.</li>
        <li>Writing materials</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h6>Procedure:</h6>
    <ul>
        <li>Clean the <strong id="tolight">magnesium</strong> ribbon by rubbing it with sand paper. Examine the appearance of the <strong id="tolight">magnesium</strong> ribbon.</li>
        <li>Hold the ribbon with a pair of tongs over a burning candle or Bunsen burner for a few minutes.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h6 id="color: red">Caution:</h6>
    <p>Burning <strong id="tolight">magnesium</strong> ribbon produces a very bright flame that can damage your eyes. Avoid looking directly at the flame. </p>
    
    <h6>Observations, Explanation & Conclusion:</h6>
    <ul>
        <li><strong id="tolight">Magnesium</strong> ribbon burns with a bright light forming a white ash. 
            If the <strong id="tolight">magnesium</strong> ribbon is not shining it may take long to ignite. 
            Therefore, is advisable to clean the ribbon by rubbing it with sand paper 
            since it is coated with an oxide layer that prevents it from burning.</li>
        <li>Burning <strong id="tolight">magnesium</strong> ribbon form a substance called <strong id="tolight">magnesium oxide</strong>
            A change in which one or more substances are formed is known as <strong id="tolight">chemical change</strong> </li>
        <li>A chemical change is also known as <strong id="tolight">permanent change</strong>. Most chemical changes are irreversible in nature. </li>
        <li>Chemical changes are important in life. Example of chemical changes include:
            <ul>
                <li>Digestion of food in the body.</li>
                <li>Ripening of fruits.</li>
                <li>Fermentation of grapes.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
