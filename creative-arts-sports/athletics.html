    <ul>
        <li>Pacing.</li>
        <li>Stride length.</li>
        <li>Recovery.</li>
    </ul><br><p>Pacing – rate at which an athlete runs. An athlete knows how long it takes them to cover a certain distance.
        <br>Stride length – it is the uniform length of steps taken during running.<br>
        Recovery - It is a stop, walk or slow jog made after striding.<br>
        It helps an athlete to catch a breath and relax before striding again which helps in developing speed and running skills.</p>
