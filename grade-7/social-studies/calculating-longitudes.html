            <li>Distance between longitudes is measured in <strong id="tolight">degrees</strong></li>
            <li>There are <strong id="tolight">360 meridians </strong>or longitudes</li>
            <li>One complete rotation is 360 ÌŠ</li>
            <li>The direction of the rotation is from west to east i.e. <strong id="tolight">anticlockwise direction.</strong></li>
            <li>One complete rotation takes <strong id="tolight">24 hours</strong></li>
            <li>All places found in the east of the Greenwich meridian will see sunrise first and therefore they are one hour ahead of those to the west</li>
