                    It is the space that contains a watery fluid (cell sap) with dissolved water, mineral salts, and waste products.

                <td>
                    A thin layer around the cell that holds it together. It controls what goes in and out of the cell, allowing it to take in necessary substances and get rid of waste products.

                <td>
                    A jelly-like liquid filling the inside of the cell. It is where chemical reactions occur and contains organelles that perform specific functions.

                <td>
                    A thick, tough layer made of cellulose, found outside the cell membrane in plant cells. It helps maintain cell shape and protects the cell from mechanical damage.

                <td>
                    An organelle in the cytoplasm of plant cells containing chlorophyll, a green pigment that absorbs light for photosynthesis.
