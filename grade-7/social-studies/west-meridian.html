    <h5>Calculating time of places found to the west of Greenwich Meridian</h5>
        <p>When calculating time to the west of Greenwich meridian we subtract the time difference to the local time</p>
            <h6>Example 1</h6>
            <p>A plane leaves off in New York, 74ºW at 7 am local time. What is the local time in Stockholm 18ºE</p>
