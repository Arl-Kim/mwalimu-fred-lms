    <h5>1.2 God’s Plan for Redemption</h5>
    <h6>How God Demonstrated His Love for Humankind After the Fall of Man</h6>
    <ul>
        <li>He gave a promise to the woman in <strong id="tolight">Genesis 3:15</strong> that “her offspring would crush the serpent’s head.” God put enmity between the serpent and the woman. This shows that God cared for humankind and did not want evil to take over.</li>
        <li>In the garden of Eden, God looked for Adam and Eve to find out where they were. They had hidden themselves among the trees in the garden. God called out to Adam and asked, “where are you?” God called out to Adam and Eve because He loved and cared for them.</li>
        <li>God made clothes for Adam and Eve to cover their bodies.</li>
        <li>In the Old Testament, God demonstrated His love for humankind by appointing prophets at different times to bring His people back to Him.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h6>How God’s Plan for Salvation is Fulfilled Through Jesus Christ</h6>
    <ul>
        <li>Salvation means deliverance from sin and its consequences.</li>
        <li>Salvation comes through having faith in Jesus Christ.</li>
        <li>Salvation starts in the Old Testament and is concluded in the New Testament through the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ.</li>
        <li>Jesus Christ died on the cross to redeem us from our sinful nature. His death reconciled us to God.</li>
