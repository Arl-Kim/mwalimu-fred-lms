    <h5>Conservation tillage can include the following systems:</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>

            <strong id="togreen">Strip tillage or zonal tillage</strong> refers to a system where strips 5 to 20 cm in width are prepared to receive the seed whilst the soil along the intervening bands is not disturbed and <strong id="tolight">remains covered with residues.</strong> The system causes more soil disturbance and provides less cover along the rows than zero tillage.
        </li>
        <li><strong id="togreen">Tined tillage or vertical tillage</strong> refers to a system where the arable land is prepared with equipment which <strong id="tolight">does not invert the soil</strong> and which cause little compaction. For this reason, the surface normally remains with a <strong id="tolight">good cover of residues </strong>on the surface.</li>
        <li><strong id="togreen">Ridge tillage</strong> is a system of ridges and furrows. The ridges may be narrow or wide and the furrows can be parallel to the contour lines or constructed with a slight slope, depending on whether the objective is to conserve moisture or to drain excess moisture. The ridges can be semi-permanent or be constructed each year which will govern the amount of residue material that remains on the surface.</li>

        <li><strong id="togreen">Conventional tillage</strong>Refers to the arable land treated by conventional tillage which <strong id="tolight">involves inversion of the soil</strong>, normally with a <strong id="tolight">moldboard </strong>or a <strong id="tolight">disc plough</strong> as the primary tillage operation, followed by secondary tillage with a <strong id="tolight">disc harrow.</strong>

        </li>
        <li><strong id="togreen">Zero tillage </strong> Refers to the arable land on which<strong id="tolight"> no tillage is applied between harvest and sowing</strong>. Zero tillage is a minimum tillage practice in which the <strong id="tolight">crop is sown directly into soil </strong>and is not tilled since the harvest of the previous crop. Weed control is achieved by the <strong id="tolight">use of herbicides</strong> and/or <strong id="tolight">appropriate mulching</strong> and stubble is retained for erosion control.</li>
    </ul>
