    <h5>Fire fighting methods at work environment</h5>
    <p>There are four fire fighting methods applicable in a work environment. These are:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong id="tolight">Cooling method</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>This is where the temperature of the burning materials is reduced to slow down the burning.</li>
                <li>A suitable example is where cold water is used to put out a fire.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            <strong id="tolight">Smothering method</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>This is where the supply of oxygen to the burning object is cut out to slow down the burning process.</li>
                <li>An example is covering a burning object with a fire blanket or sand.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            <strong id="tolight">Starving method</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>This method involves the following activities:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Removing combustible items from the vicinity of the fire.</li>
                        <li>Removing the parts of the burning material from the mass of burning material. For example, removing a burning piece of wood from a large pile.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            <strong id="tolight">Interrupting method</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>This is the use of chemical sprays that stops burning.</li>
                <li>An example is the use of foam and carbon dioxide fire extinguishers.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
