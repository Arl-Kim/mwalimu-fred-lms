    <h6>Note:</h6>
    <ol>
        <li>Some contractions look the same but are formed from different words.
        <h6>Examples:</h6>
        <p>he is, he has = he's</p>
        <p>we had, we would = we'd</p>
        </li>
        <li>Some possessive pronouns sound like contractions. Because the words sound alike, they are sometimes confused.</li>

    <h6>Rules of Using Possessive Pronouns and Contractions Correctly:</h6>
    <ol>
        <li>If the word you want to use stands for two words, it is a contraction and needs an apostrophe.</li>
        <li>Never use an apostrophe in a possessive pronoun.</li>
    </ol>
